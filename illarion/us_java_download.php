<h2>Download the client</h2>

<h3>System requirements</h3>

<h4>Minimum</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Operating System:
    <ul>
      <li>Windows:  2000, XP, XP 64-bit, Vista, Vista 64-bit, 7 and 7 64-bit</li>
      <li>Linux: Kernel 2.4.20 or newer</li>
      <li>MacOS X 10.6 or more recent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Graphics card: 64MB memory, driver supporting OpenGL, Shader 2.0 support</li>
  <li>CPU: Dual core processor with 1.4 GHz</li>
  <li>Java 6</li>
</ul>

<h4>Recommended</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Operating system:
    <ul>
      <li>Windows XP, Vista, Vista 64-bit, 7, 7 64-bit</li>
      <li>Linux</li>
      <li>MacOS X 10.65 or more recent</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Graphics card: 128MB dedicated memory, driver supporting OpenGL, Shader 2.0 support</li>
  <li>CPU: Dual core processor with 2.0 GHz</li>
  <li>Java 7 (64-bit Version if you have a 64-bit operating system installed)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Note</h4>

<p>Windows Vista, Windows 7 and many Linux versions don't have drivers
supporting OpenGL hardware acceleration installed by default. Drivers that
support this feature can be found on your graphics card manufacturers
website.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>The installation takes several steps. First a tool will start up to help
you through the installation of the client. This program will download the
client for you and keep it up to date.</p>

<p>For the Client and the download to work, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is needed.
If you're not sure whether or not, you have the latest version installed, or
any version at all, you should download the latest version. Java is freely
provided by Oracle.</p>

<p><a href="http://java.com">Java download page (external page)</a></p>

<p>To start the client installation, you click on the
&quot;Online installation&quot; link. The file downloaded by that
(illarion_client.jnlp) is a Java-webstart file and should be run by your Java
Runtime Environment.</p>

<p>When starting the &quot;Illarion Client&quot; a warning message, concerning
a potential security risk may appear. This message may <b>for now</b> be
ignored. With this warning Java wants to point out that this application will access
your computer. This is necessary for the client as files need to be saved on to your
machine.</p>

<p>

		Online Installation
	</a>
</p>

<p>If there should be problems during the installation or start of the client,
please ask for help on the IRC chat or the forum. There's almost no problem,
we can't find a solution for.</p>

<h2>Additional Applications</h2>

<p>Within the Illarion client, Illarion provides additional applications
for you to use. These are mainly used for further development of Illarion. For
more information, please ask on the IRC chat.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/media/java/illarion_download.jnlp">
			Illarion-starter
		</a>
		(With this application, all of the other applications will be started, including the client itself.)
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/media/java/illarion_easynpc.jnlp">
			Illarion easyNPC-Editor
		</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/media/java/illarion_easyquest.jnlp">
			Illarion easyQuest-Editor
		</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="<?php echo Page::getURL(); ?>/media/java/illarion_mapeditor.jnlp">
			Illarion Map-Editor
		</a>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Solve certificate error</h2>

<p>Upon starting the Illarion applications, a message appears saying, that
the certificate the applications has been signed with cannot be verified or
has not been signed by a trusted certification authority.</p>

<p>This error appears, because Illarion uses CAcert as the certification
authority. Java, however, has not listed CAcert as a trustworthy certification
authority yet.</p>

<p>For the Illarion certificate to be verified and the validity to be ensured,
the necessary certificate must be embedded in Java.</p>

<h3>Downloading the root certificates</h3>

<p>First you have to download the root certificates from CAcert.</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.cacert.org/index.php?id=3&amp;lang=de">
		Download page of CAcert (external page)
	</a>
</p>

<p>From this page download the &quot;Class 1 PKI-Key&quot; and the
&quot;Class 3 PKI-Key&quot; each in &quot;PEM Format&quot;.
Further installation is depending on your operating system.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>On Windows, open Windows Control Panel and look for the entry
&quot;Java&quot;. In the window that will open, choose the
&quot;Security&quot; tab and click on the &quot;Certificates&quot; button. In
the new window, choose &quot;Signer-CA&quot; as &quot;Certificate type&quot;
entry. Use the &quot;Import&quot; button to install the certificate that have
been downloaded.</p>

<p>When you're done close all windows. With that, all certificates should get
verified correctly.</p>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>On Linux it is best to use the ;keytool&quot; from Java, to perform the
installation. If Java is installed correctly, the program should be in this
path.</p>

<p><pre>
$ keytool -keystore $/PATH/TO/CACERTS/KEYSTORE \
	-storepass changeit -import \
	-trustcacerts -v \
	-alias cacertclass1 \
	-file root.crt
$ keytool -keystore $/PATH/TO/CACERTS/KEYSTORE \
	-storepass changeit -import \
	-trustcacerts -v \
	-alias cacertclass3 \
	-file class3.crt
</pre></p>

<p>Usually the Keystore can be found here:</p>
<ul>
	<li>/usr/lib/jvm/java-$VERSION/jre/lib/security/cacerts</li>
</ul>
