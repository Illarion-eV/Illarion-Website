	and avoid any possible aggression. Their vast discretion keeps them from interfering
	with the lives of other people. They hate large crowds of people and would never
	push into the foreground.</p>

	<br />
	<b>Positive characteristics</b>
	<p>Very cultured, reasonable </p>

	<br />

	<p>Unsociable, very introverted</p>
