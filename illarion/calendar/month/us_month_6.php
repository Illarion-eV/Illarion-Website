	<h1>Ronas</h1>

	<h2>Month of Generosity</h2>

	<p>The second month of Summer was named after Ronagan, who is known in Albar, Gynk
	and Salkamar as god of shadows, secrecy and thieves. The Serinjah know Ronagan as
	god of freedom, fishermen and hunters, but also as god of secrecy and trickery.</p>

	<p>It is rumored that there are secret meetings of Ronagan-followers - thief guilds
	- in towns of Gynk, Salkamar and Albar. But this rumor is unproven and has been told
	again and again over centuries.</p>
