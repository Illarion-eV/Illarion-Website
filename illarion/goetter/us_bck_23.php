   <h2>Sirani - Goddess of Love and Pleasure</h2>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Protection of people in love, or for love, or for attention of loved ones, advice for young
   females</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Friendly, intelligent, sympathetic, sometimes the desire for pleasure overpowers her sense of
   reason</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears disguised as young and very attractive female of any race. Often joins festivities and
   partys for amusement. Sometimes cares for lonely people.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes parties, love, fun, live itself, making friends. Dislikes rough or very selfish people.
   Dislikes the word &quot;bitch&quot; - can become very furious when someone uses it near her, or
   when insulted.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Many young females pray to her for advice in love or simple beauty tips. Most Sirani priests are
   good healers. Her followers believe in peace and harmony, and most of them don&#39;t like
   weapons or violence. In the Sirani temples, poor people are healed and given food, and a place
   to sleep, and work if they can. Some of those become Sirani priests. The followers believe that,
   when they die, Sirani will look into their heart, and then kiss them. If they have been good,
   they will awake in paradise. If not, and they regret their doings, they will be forgiven and
   enlightened by the Goddess kiss, and awake in paradise too. The evil ones who do not regret,
   will be &quot;washed&quot; from their guilt by the kiss of the Goddess, and loose most of their
   knowledge - and will awake as a newborn, unguilty child.</p>
