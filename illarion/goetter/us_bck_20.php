   <h2>Cherga - Goddess of Spirits and the Underworld </h2>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Avoiding death, healing of ill people(spare them), rest and protection for the dead, bring rest
   to undead, sometimes help for necromancers</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Neutral, dignified, proud, seldom shows emotions. Mostly peaceful, but always serious. You would
   not like to have her as an enemy, as in her rage she is merciless.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as black dressed, dark haired or gray haired ageless woman with gray skin color, or as
   old poor-dressed witch or gypsy, that foretells the future. Is feared as the bringer of doom and
   unwelcomed news.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes Balance and justice. Does not care much about the living.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   There are not many followers of Cherga. Cherga is the one who collects the dead ones, and brings
   them to the realms they belong to. Some people pray to her to give them forbidden knowledge and
   power over the undead, some (good) people to give eternal rest to the restless, others to use
   the undead for a purpose. Many necromancers are followers of Cherga, but many fortune tellers
   too. Cherga does not care what the mortals do with the knowledge, and most of this knowledge has
   a high price. Followers of Cherga believe that when they die, they can choose to live on as a
   lich or skeleton, or serve Cherga in helping to direct the souls of the dead to their
   destination places, until they themselves will be reborn to be allowed to start a new life. Most
   people who follow Cherga simply want to gain immortality.</p>
