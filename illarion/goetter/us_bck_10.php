   <h1>The Gods of Illarion</h1>

   <?php cap(T); ?>
   
   <p>here are many Gods, many myths, and many legends. The stories told by the Gods to a few
   chosen mortals, may have been changed by the priest&#39;s tongues, to glorify their actions and
   to attract attention. Or sometimes, a prophet has added the one or another part. The Gods
   themselves do not care much about the details - the whole thing must just go in the right
   direction. This here is a quick overview about the God&#39;s churches, and their
   beliefs.</p>

   <h2>The Elder Ones</h2>

   <p>Not much is known about their origin, and they seldom let others know something about their
   past. Some people claim to know the answer, but who knows if these stories are true. Most of
   them have retreated from Illarion - no one knows where they went - and do not like to be
   disturbed by mortals. But sometimes, they return and take action.</p>

   <p>The Elder Gods pick their few followers themselves, with one exception : Tanora
   (Zelphia).</p>

   <p class="center">
      <a href="us_bck_11.php">Ushara - Goddess of Earth</a><br />

      <a href="us_bck_13.php">Eldan - God of Spirit</a><br />
      <a href="us_bck_14.php">Tanora - Goddess of Water</a><br />
      <a href="us_bck_15.php">Findari - Goddess of Air</a>
   </p>

   <h2>The Younger Ones</h2>

   <p>Created by the Elder Gods to guard and guide the races of Illarion, the Younger Ones are
   still heavily involved in life itself. But since the Elder Ones more or less retreated from
   Illarion, seldom to be seen, they started to take sides in the struggle between the powers on
   Illarion. Instead of leading the different races and ensuring their peacefull coexistence, they
   themself take part in the struggle, fighting for influence and power.</p>
