	We, the knights of the Grey Rose, think highly of honour and loyalty. We live with a
	strict code which is the base for our guild and our behaviour. We strive for peace and
	order between all beings. We select our squires as carefully as we select our
	knights, which are chosen from among our squires. In our stronghold (HP) you can
	find out more about us and our goals. Every visitor who wants to look around in peace
	is warmly welcome.

	<br /><br />
	The oldest organisation of illarion is the Order of the Grey Light. Goals of the
	Order are: upbuilding and keeping law and order; keeping the balance in all things,
	neutrality and harmony; keeping and enhancing knowledge, history and scholarship.
	While the "Scribes" of the Order act as scholars, philosophers, tacticians, bards or
	judges, the "Templars" of the order are fighters or fighter mages, law-keepers,
	soldiers, judges or paladins. Templars and Scribes follow the Grey Codex. Accepted
	as members are only those who have proven as honorable and worthy.
