##Installation

To fully setup the web page you need the database that is stored in the
[Repository of the Illarion Server](https://github.com/Illarion-eV/Illarion-Server/blob/master/setup/illarion.sql).
In addition you need to restore the required components that are included using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). This page will give you a basic idea of
what exactly you need to do to install the composer. You need to run the
`install` command with the composer to get all the libraries setup properly.
