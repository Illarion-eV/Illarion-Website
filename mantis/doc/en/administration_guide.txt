Chapter 1. About MantisBT

1.1. What is MantisBT?

   MantisBT is a web based bug tracking system that was first made
   available to the public in November 2000. Over time it has
   matured and gained a lot of popularity, and now it has become
   one of the most popular open source bug/issue tracking systems.
   MantisBT is developed in PHP, with support to multiple database
   backends including MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL and DB2.

   MantisBT, as a PHP script, can run on any operating system that
   is supported by PHP and has support for one of the DBMSes that
   are supported. MantisBT is known to run fine on Windows, Linux,
   OS/2, Mac OS X, System i and a variety of Unix operating
   systems.
     __________________________________________________________

1.2. Who should read this manual?

   This manual is targeted for the person responsible for
   evaluating, installing and maintaing MantisBT in a company.
   Typically we refer to this person as the MantisBT
   administrator.
     __________________________________________________________

1.3. License

   MantisBT is released under the terms of GNU General Public
   License (GPL). MantisBT is free to use and modify. It is free
   to redistribute as long as you abide by the distribution terms
   of the GPL.
     __________________________________________________________

1.4. Minimum Requirements

   MantisBT has modest software and hardware requirements. It
   requires a computer that is able to run the server software.
   All of the required software is free for commercial or
   non-commercial use. The server can be a shared public web
   server or a dedicated co-located box. The disk space required
   will depend on the size of the database, however, it is
   typically driven by the expected number and size of the
   attachments.

     * Operating System: MantisBT runs on Windows, MacOS, OS/2,
       Linux, Solaris, the BSDs, and just about anything that
       supports the required server software.
     * Web Server: MantisBT is mainly tested with Microsoft IIS
       and Apache. However, it is expected to work with any decent
       web server software.
     * PHP: The web server must have PHP installed on it. It can
       be installed as CGI or whatever other integration
       technology that is supported by PHP and the web server.
       Required version is PHP 5.1.x or higher. Recommended
       version is PHP 5.2.x.
     * Database: MantisBT requires a database to store its data.
       The supported DBMSes include MySQL (4.1.x or higher), MS
       SQL, PostgreSQL and DB2.
     * Browser: MantisBT aims to support most of the browsers in
       the market. The mainly supported ones are Internet Explorer
       and Firefox. However, browsers like Safari, Chrome and
       Opera should also work fine although they are not used by
       most developers during development and testing.
     __________________________________________________________

1.5. How to get it?

   MantisBT is available in several Linux distributions including:
   Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, Frugalware and others. Hence,
   if you are running Linux, start by checking if your
   distribution has a package for MantisBT. If not, or if the
   package is not up-to-date with the latest MantisBT version,
   then you may want to download it directly from here.

   For Windows, Mac OS X and other operating systems, use the link
   provided above to download MantisBT. The download is compressed
   in tar.gz or zip format. Both formats can be unpacked using
   tools like 7-Zip (in case of Windows).

   Note that at any point in time there are typically two "latest"
   MantisBT releases that are available for download. The latest
   production release (stable), and the latest development release
   which can be an alpha or a release candidate. It is not
   recommended to use development releases in production specially
   if it is still in the alpha stage unless the administrator is
   familiar with PHP and is able to troubleshoot and fix any
   issues that may arise.
     __________________________________________________________

1.6. About the Name

   When initially seeking to name this project Ken ran into a
   problem every programmer encounters. What is a good name? It
   has to be descriptive, unique, and not too verbose.
   Additionally having multiple meanings would be a nice touch.
   Quickly ruled out were php*Something* names which,
   incidentally, although popular, do not seem to be condoned by
   the PHP Group developers. Drawing inspiration from Open Source
   projects like Apache, Mozilla, Gnome, and so forth resulted in
   two eventual choices: Dragonfly and Mantis. Dragonfly was
   already the name of a webmail package. So the name became
   Mantis.

   Praying Mantis are insects that feed primarily on other insects
   and bugs. They are extremely desirable in agriculture as they
   devour insects that feed on crops. They are also extremely
   elegant looking creatures. So, we have a name that is fairly
   distinctive and descriptive in multiple ways. The BT suffix
   stands for "Bug Tracker" and distinguishes this project from
   general usage of the word Mantis. However, over time the
   project was typically referred to as Mantis.
     __________________________________________________________

1.7. History

   Kenzaburo Ito and a friend originally created a bug tracker as
   an internal tool for their pet project. A search for good, free
   packages came up with nothing suitable so they wrote their own.
   After a rewrite and cleanup it was made available to the public
   via the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GPL was chosen
   partly because of his belief that development tools should be
   cheap or free. In 2002, Ken was joined by Jeroen Latour, Victor
   Boctor and Julian Fitzell to be the administrators and the core
   development team of MantisBT. This marks a new era in MantisBT
   lifetime where it is now a team project.
     __________________________________________________________

1.8. Support

   There are plenty of resources to help answer support queries.
   Following are the main ones:

     * Forums - The forums are one of the most popular
       destinations for getting MantisBT support. Start off by
       searching the forums for your questions, if not found, then
       go ahead and submit a question.
     * Mailing lists - Available mailing lists are
       "mantisbt-announce" for announcements, "mantisbt-dev" for
       development issues, mantisbt-lang for localization and
       "mantisbt-help" for general help/support questions. There
       are public archives for such mailing lists. Note that only
       members of the mailing lists can post to them, hence,
       subscribe to the lists before you attempt to email them.
     * IRC - The IRC channel is mainly used by developers to
       engage in in-person discussion. The recommended tool for
       IRC is XChat (for Linux), XChat 2 (for Windows). However,
       you can also use Web Chat to connect to IRC via your web
       browser. This is also useful when your work firewall blocks
       the IRC port (although there are other workarounds
       involving tunneling to fix this issue). Many people prefer
       to use IRC to ask questions to the developers and other
       users who are in the IRC channel. The IRC channel logs are
       archived and made available on the web. (TODO: add irc logs
       link)
     * Wiki - The MantisBT Wiki has information related to "How To
       (recipes)", FAQ, feature requirements, etc.
     * Search - A good way for locating an answer for your
       question or finding more information about a topic is to
       search across all MantisBT website and the Internet via
       Google or Bing.

   It is important to note that support questions should not be
   sent directly to MantisBT developers or through the MantisBT
   contact us pages. Use of "Contact Us" page or emailing the
   developer directly is available if you are after a paid support
   or consulting service.
     __________________________________________________________

1.9. MantisBT News

   There are several ways to keep up to date with MantisBT news.
   These include:

     * mantisbt-announce mailing list is a very low traffic list
       that is used for major announcements, typically
       announcements about releases. All MantisBT users are
       encouraged to subscribe to this mailing list. The average
       traffic should be no more than one to two posts per month.
     * MantisBT Blog is used to communicate announcements about
       new releases, topics relating to MantisBT, etc. Users are
       encouraged to subscribe to the RSS feed to know when new
       posts are posted there.
     * Twitter is used to notify users about up-to-date details
       about what is happening with MantisBT development. For
       example, a Twitter update is automatically posted by the
       official bug tracker whenever an issue is resolved. Twitter
       users are encouraged to follow "mantisbt".
     __________________________________________________________

1.10. Versioning

   The release numbering convention we use is major.minor.micro
   (eg. 1.2.0rc1).

     * Major - Indicates a very large change in the core package.
       Rewrites or major milestones.
     * Minor - Significant amount of feature
       addition/modification.
     * Micro - Mostly bug fixes and maintenance releases.
     * Suffix - rc1 for first release candidate, a1 for alpha 1,
       etc.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Installation

   Following are the steps for a new MantisBT installation:

     * Download Mantis
     * Go through MantisBT Configuration and set the database
       options + whatever options where you need to override the
       default values.
     * Test your configuration through the admin folder
     * Create a new administrator account and remove the standard
       user 'administrator'
     __________________________________________________________

2.1. Summary

    1. Tranfer files
    2. Uncompress files
    3. Generate database tables
    4. Edit configuration file, if needed
    5. PHP File extensions
    6. Login
    7. Add projects and users
     __________________________________________________________

2.2. New Installations

    1. First, transfer the file to your webserver using whatever
       method you likebest (ftp, scp, etc). You will need to
       telnet/ssh into the server machine forthe next steps.
    2. Next, untar/gunzip it to the directory that you want.The
       usual command is (1 step): tar zxvf <filename.tar.gz> OR (2
       steps): gunzip <filename.tar.gz> tar xvf <filename.tar>
       Winzip, Stuffit, and other programs should also be able to
       handledecompression of the archive.At this point you may
       want to rename the directory to something simpler like
       'mantisbt'. You will use the mv command to rename a
       directory (Windows users substitute the "ren" command or
       use explorer). mv <directoryname> mantisbt
    3. Next we will create the necessary database tables and a
       basic configurationfile.From your web server, access
       http://yoursite/mantisbt/admin/install.php. This page will
       walk through the following steps:
         a. check basic parameters for the web server
         b. prompt for the database type and location, and a
            database user/passwordpair. For installion, an
            administrative user/password pair can also be
            provided. The operating user requires SELECT, INSERT,
            UPDATE, and DELETE privileges. For installation,
            INDEX, CREATE, ALTER, and DROP privileges arealso
            required.
         c. create the database and tables. WARNING: A DEFAULT
            ADMINISTRATOR level account is created. The account
            name and password are administrator / root. Use this
            when you first login to MantisBT. Immediately go to
            Manage and create at least one administrator level
            account. Immediately after that DISABLE or DELETE the
            administrator account. You can recreate it but you
            should delete the account to prevent the cookie_string
            from being used to trick the package. It would be even
            better to rename the account or delete it permanently.
            REMEMBER: After setting up the package, REMOVE the
            default administrator account.
         d. write a basic "config_inc.php file to define the
            database.
         e. perform some post installation checks on the system.
    4. The next part involves configuring the installation to work
       with yourspecific setup.Open the file in an editor and add
       anyother values that are required. There aremany more that
       you can use to customize your MantisBT installation. See
       Configuration for in depth explanations.The file will
       overwrite the default values with those necessary for
       setup.You can load up admin/check.php to see if you set
       things up correctly. NOTE: check.php sometimes reports the
       value of register_globalsincorrectly. Create a page with
       this line in it: <? phpinfo() ?>, save itwith a .php
       extension and load it up in your web browser. It will,
       among amultitude of other things, have the correct value of
       register_globals that youare using.
    5. MantisBT now uses only .php files.If your webserver is
       configured for other extensions (.PHP3, .PHTML) then
       youwill have to have the administrator add support for .PHP
       files. This shouldbe a trivial modification.Documentation
       can be found at:
       http://www.php.net/manual/en/installation.php
    6. Login to your bugtracker and go to the manage section.
       Click on the projects link. You will need to ADD a new
       project. Then EDIT the new project and remember to ADD at
       least one category. Otherwise you won't be able to add any
       issues. That should be it. You're off and running.
     __________________________________________________________

2.3. Requirements

   The following versions are required for proper operation:

   Package Minimum Version Tested with
   MySQL 4.1.x 5.0.x
   PostgreSQL (experimental) 7.0 8.0
   PHP 5.2.x 5.2.x
   Web Server   Apache 1.3.x, Apache 2.2.x, lighttpd 1.4.x, IIS
   6.0

   MantisBT is designed in a way to work in as many environments
   as possible. Hence the required extensions are minimal and many
   of them are optional affecting only one feature. The following
   PHP extensions are the ones used:

     * mysqli (or the extension for the DBMS being used) -
       mandatory.
     * Curl - if the Twitter integration feature is required.
     * GD - if the graphs feature is required.
     * fileinfo - Guesses the MIME type of attachments. This
       extension is included by default from version 5.3.x of PHP.
       For older versions of PHP you will need to install the
       fileinfo PECL extension (this requires root access to the
       server you're using). Without this extension, file
       attachment previews and downloads may not work correctly as
       MantisBT won't be able to send the Content-Type header to a
       browser requesting an attachment.
     __________________________________________________________

2.4. Backups

   It is recommended to backup your MantisBT database on a regular
   basis. This is easy to accomplish using the mysqldump command:
   mysqldump -u<username> -p<password> <database name> > <output
   file> To restore a backup you will need to have a clean
   database. Then run: mysql -u<username> -p<password> <database
   name> < <input file> You can also perform both of these tasks
   using phpMyAdmin A good idea is to make a backup script and run
   it regularly through cron or a task scheduler (for Windows see
   WinCron ). Using the current date in the filename can prevent
   overwriting and make cataloguing easier. !!! Backups should
   always be performed before an upgrade !!! Make sure to backup
   MantisBT code (which includes your configs + possibly
   customization), issue attachments / project documents, and
   database contents.
     __________________________________________________________

2.5. Uninstall

   It is recommended that you make an backup in case you wish to
   use your data in the future. See the Backups page for details.
   To uninstall MantisBT:

     * Delete the MantisBT directory and all files and
       subdirectories.
     * Drop all MantisBT tables from the database, these can be
       identified by the configured prefix for the installation.
       The default prefix is 'mantis'.
     * Remove any customizations or additions that you may have
       made.

   If you have the permissions to create/drop databases and you
   have a specific database for MantisBT that does not contain any
   other data, you can drop the whole database.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. User Management

3.1. Creating User Accounts

   In MantisBT, there is no limit on the number of user accounts
   that can be created. Typically, installations with thousands of
   users tend to have a limited number of users that have access
   level above REPORTER.

   By default users with ADMINISTRATOR access level have access to
   create new user accounts. The steps to do that are:

     * Click "Manage" on Main Menu.
     * Click "Manage Users" (if not selected by default).
     * Click "Create New Account" button just below the alphabet
       key.
     * Enter user name, email address, global access level (more
       details about access levels later). Other fields are
       optional.
     * Click "Create Users".

   Creating a user triggers the following actions:

     * Creating a user in the database.
     * If email notifications ($g_enable_email_notification) is
       set to ON, then the user will receive an email allowing
       them to activate their account and set their password.
       Otherwise, the account will be created with a blank
       password.
     * If email notifications ($g_enable_email_notification) is
       set to ON, users with access level about
       $g_notify_new_user_created_threshold_min will get a
       notification that a user account has been created.
       Information about the user like user name and email address
       are provided. The IP of the user that created the account
       is also included.

   When the 'Protected' flag is set on a user account, it
   indicates that the account is a shared account (e.g. demo
   account) and hence users logged using such account will not be
   allowed to change account preferences and profile information.

   The anonymous user account specified with the
   $g_anonymous_account option will always be treated as a
   protected user account. When you are creating the anonymous
   user account, the 'Protected' flag is essentially ignored
   because the anonymous user is always treated as a protected
   user.
     __________________________________________________________

3.2. Enabling/Disabling User Accounts

   The recommended way of retiring user accounts is to disable
   them. Scenarios where this is useful is when a person leaves
   the team and it is necessary to retire their account.

   Once an account is disabled the following will be enforced:

     * All currently active sessions for the account will be
       invalidated (i.e. automatically logged out).
     * It will no longer be possible login using this account.
     * No further email notifications will be sent to the account
       once it is disabled.
     * The user account will not show anymore in lists like
       "assign to", "send reminder to", etc.

   The disabling process is totally reversible. Hence, the account
   can be re-enabled and all the account history will remain
   intact. For example, the user will still have issues reported
   by them, assigned to them, monitored by them, etc.
     __________________________________________________________

3.3. Deleting User Accounts

   Another way to retire user accounts is by deleting them. This
   approach is only recommended for accounts that have not been
   active (i.e. haven't reported issues). Once the account is
   deleted, any issues or actions associated with such account,
   will be associated with user123 (where 123 is the code of the
   account that was deleted). Note that associated issues or
   actions are not deleted.

   As far as the underlying database, after the deletion of a
   user, records with the user id as a foreign key will have a
   value that no longer exists in the users table. Hence, any
   tools that operate directly on the database must take this into
   consideration.

   By default administrators are the only users who can delete
   user accounts. They can delete accounts by clicking Manage,
   Manage Users, locating the user to be deleted and opening it
   details page, then clicking on the "Delete User" button which
   deletes the user.

   Note that "Deleting Users" is not a reversible process. Hence,
   if it is required to re-add the user account, it is not
   possible to recreate the user account so that it gets the same
   ID and hence retains its history. However, manually creating a
   record in the users table with the same id, can possibly do
   that. However, this approach is not recommended or supported.
     __________________________________________________________

3.4. User Signup

   For open source and freeware projects, it is very common to
   setup MantisBT so that users can signup for an account and get
   a REPORTER access by default (configurable by the
   $g_default_new_account_access_level configuration option). The
   signup process can be enabled / disabled using the
   $g_allow_signup configuration option, which is enabled by
   default.

   If email notifications ($g_enable_email_notification) is set to
   ON, users with access level about
   $g_notify_new_user_created_threshold_min will get a
   notification that a user account has been created. Information
   about the user like user name, email address, IP address are
   included in the email notification.
     __________________________________________________________

3.5. Forgot Password and Reset Password

   It is pretty common for users to forget their password.
   MantisBT provides two ways to handle such scenario: "Forgot
   Password" and "Reset Password".

   "Forgot Password" is a self service scenario where users go to
   the login page, figure out they don't remember their password,
   and then click the "Lost your password?" link. Users are then
   asked for their user name and email address. If correct, then
   they are sent an email with a link which allows them to login
   to MantisBT and change their password.

   "Reset Password" scenario is where a user reports to the
   administrator that they are not able to login into MantisBT
   anymore. This can be due to forgetting their password and
   possibly user name or email address that they used when signing
   up. The administrator then goes to Manage, Manage Users,
   locates the user account and opens its details. Under the user
   account details, there is a "Reset Password" button which the
   administrator can click to reset the password and trigger an
   email to the user to allow them to get into MantisBT and set
   their password. In the case where email notifications are
   disabled, resetting password will set the password to an empty
   string.
     __________________________________________________________

3.6. Changing Password

   Users are able to change their own passwords (unless their
   account is "protected"). This can be done by clicking on "My
   Account", and then typing the new password in the "Password"
   and "Confirm Password" fields, then clicking "Update User".
   Changing the password automatically invalidates all logged in
   sessions and hence the user will be required to re-login.
   Invalidating existing sessions is very useful in the case where
   a user going onto a computer, logs into MantisBT and leaves the
   computer without logging out. By changing the password from
   another computer, the session on the original computer
   automatically becomes invalidated.
     __________________________________________________________

3.7. Pruning User Accounts

   The pruning function allows deleting of user accounts for
   accounts that have been created more than a week ago, and they
   never logged in. This is particulary useful for users who
   signed up with an invalid email or with a typo in their email
   address address.

   The account pruning can be done by administrators by going to
   "Manage", "Manage Users", and clicking the "Prune Accounts"
   button inside the "Never Logged In" box.
     __________________________________________________________

3.8. Authorization and Access Levels

   MantisBT uses access levels to define what a user can do. Each
   user account has a global or default access level that is
   associated with it. This access level is used as the access
   level for such users for all actions associated with public
   projects as well as actions that are not related to a specific
   project. Users with global access level less than
   $g_private_project_threshold will not have access to private
   projects by default.

   The default access levels shipped with MantisBT out of the box
   are VIEWER, REPORTER, UPDATER, DEVELOPER, MANAGER and
   ADMINISTRATOR. Each features has several configuration options
   associated with it and identifies the required access level to
   do certain actions. For example, viewing an issue, reporting an
   issue, updating an issue, adding a note, etc.

   For example, in the case of reporting issues, the required
   access level is configurable using the $g_report_bug_threshold
   configuration option (which is defaulted to REPORTER). So for a
   user to be able to report an issue against a public project,
   the user must have a project-specific or a global access level
   that is greater than or equal to REPORTER. However, in the case
   of reporting an issue against a private project, the user must
   have project specific access level (that is explicitly granted
   against the project) that is higher than REPORTER or have a
   global access level that is higher than both
   $g_private_project_threshold and $g_report_bug_threshold.

   Note that project specific access levels override the global
   access levels. For example, a user may have REPORTER as the
   global access level, but have a MANAGER access level to a
   specific project. Or a user may have MANAGER as the global
   access level by VIEWER access to a specific project. Access
   levels can be overriden for both public and private projects.
   However, overriding access level is not allowed for users with
   global access ADMINISTRATOR.

   Each feature typically has multiple access control
   configuration options to defines what access level can do
   certain operations. For example, adding a note may require
   REPORTER access level, updating a note my require DEVELOPER
   access level, unless the own was owned by the same user and in
   this case REPORTER access level. Such threshold configuration
   options can be set to a single access level, which means users
   with such threshold and above are authorized to do such action.
   The other option is to specify an array of access level which
   indicates that users with the explicitly specific thresholds
   are allowed to do such actions.

   It is also worth mentioning that the access levels are defined
   by the $g_access_levels_enum_string configuration option, and
   it is possible to customize such list. The default value for
   the available access levels is '10:viewer, 25:reporter,
   40:updater, 55:developer, 70:manager, 90:administrator'. The
   instructions about how to customize the list of access levels
   will be covered in the customization section.
     __________________________________________________________

3.9. Auto Creation of Accounts on Login

   In some cases MantisBT is setup in a way, where it allows users
   that already exists in a directory or another application to be
   automatically authenticated and added to MantisBT. For example,
   a company may setup their MantisBT installation in a way, where
   its staff members that are already registered in their LDAP
   directory, should be allowed to login into MantisBT with the
   same user name and password. Another example, is where MantisBT
   is integrated into some content management system, where it is
   desired to have a single registration and single sign-on
   experience. In such scenarios, once a user logs in for the
   first time, a user account is automatically created for them,
   although the password verification is still done against LDAP
   or the main users repository.
     __________________________________________________________

3.10. User Preferences

   Users can fine tune they way MantisBT interacts with them via
   modifying their user preferences. User preferences can only be
   managed by users and are not available for the administrators
   to tweak. The administrators can only tweak the default value
   for such preferences. However, once a user account is created,
   it is then the responsibility of the user to manage their own
   preferences. The user preferences include the following:

     * Default Project: A user can choose the default project that
       is selected when the user first logs in. This can be a
       specific project or "All Projects". For users that only
       work on one project, it would make sense to set such
       project as the default project (rather than "All
       Projects"). The active project is part of the filter
       applied on the issues listed in the "View Issues" page.
       Also any newly reported issues will be associated with the
       active project.
     * Refresh Delay: The refresh delay is used to specify the
       number of seconds between auto-refreshes of the View Issues
       page.
     * Redirect Delay: The redirect delay is the number of seconds
       to wait after displaying flash messages like "Issue created
       successfully", and before the user gets redirected to the
       next page.
     * Notes Sort Order: The preference relating to how notes
       should be ordered on an issue is viewed or in email
       notifications. The ascending order is where notes are
       ordered so that ordered notes appear before newer notes,
       the descending order is the reverse.
     * Email on New: If unticked, then email notifications
       relating to creation of a new issue would be disabled. Note
       that the preference is only used to disabled notifications
       that as per the administrator's configuration, this user
       would have qualified to receive them.
     * Email on Change of Handler: TODO - is this preference used?
     * Email on Feedback: TODO - is this preference used?
     * Email on Resolved: TODO
     * Email on Closed: TODO
     * Email on Reopened: TODO
     * Email on Note Added: TODO
     * Email on Status Change: TODO
     * Email on Priority Change: TODO - is this preference used?
     * Email Notes Limit: This preference can be used to limit the
       number of issue notes to view or to be included in an email
       notifications. Specifying N here means that the latest N
       notes will be included. The value 0 causes all notes to be
       included.
     * Language: The preferred language of the user. This language
       is used by the GUI and in email notifications. Note that
       MantisBT uses UTF8 for encoding the data, and hence, the
       user can be interacting with MantisBT user interface in
       Chinese while logging issue data in German.
     __________________________________________________________

3.11. User Profiles

   A user profile describes an environment that the user uses to
   run the software for which issues are being tracked. The
   profile information include "Platform", "Operating System", "OS
   Version", and "Additional Description". Each user has access to
   profiles that they create (can be multiple), in addition to
   global ones that are shared created by other users. When
   reporting issues, users can elect to enter information like
   platform, operating system, version manually, or they can
   choose from the list of profiles that are already defined.

   Global profiles are typically used by the administrator to
   define a set of standard profiles that are typically used by
   the MantisBT users. This makes it easier for the users to use
   such profiles without having to define create them. The access
   level required for users to be able to create global profiles
   is configured by the $g_manage_global_profile_threshold
   configuration option and it is defaulted to MANAGER.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Issue Lifecycle and Workflow

4.1. Issue Creation

   The life cycle of an issue starts with its creation. An issue
   can be created via one of the following channels:

     * MantisBT Web Interface - This is where a user logs into
       MantisBT and reports a new issue.
     * SOAP API - Where an application automatically reports an
       issue into MantisBT using the SOAP API web services
       interfaces. For example, the nighlty build script can
       automatically report an issue if the build fails.
     * Email - This is not supported out of the box, but there are
       existing MantisBT patches that would listen to emails on
       pre-configured email addresses and adds them to the
       MantisBT database.
     * Others - There can be several other ways to report issues.
       For example, applications / scripts that directly injects
       issues into MantisBT database (not recommended, except for
       one-off migration scripts), or PHP scripts that use the
       core MantisBT API to create new issues.
     __________________________________________________________

4.2. Issue Statuses

   An important part of issue tracking is to classify issues as
   per their status. Each team may decide to have a different set
   of categorization for the status of the issues, and hence,
   MantisBT provides the ability to customize the list of
   statuses. MantisBT assumes that an issue can be in one of three
   stages: opened, resolved and closed. Hence, the customized
   statuses list will be mapped to these three stages. For
   example, MantisBT comes out of the box with the following
   statuses: new, feedback, acknowledged, confirmed, assigned,
   resolved and closed. In this case "new" -> "assigned" map to
   opened, "resolved" means resolved and "closed" means closed.

   Following is the explanation of what the standard statuses that
   are shipped with MantisBT means.

     * New - This is the landing status for new issues. Issues
       stay in this status until they are assigned, acknowledged,
       confirmed or resolved. The next status can be
       "acknowledged", "confirmed", "assigned" or "resolved".
     * Acknowledged - This status is used by the development team
       to reflect their agreement to the suggested feature
       request. Or to agree with what the reporter is suggesting
       in an issue report, although they didn't yet attempt to
       reproduce what the reporter is referring to. The next
       status is typically "assigned" or "confirmed".
     * Confirmed - This status is typically used by the
       development team to mention that they agree with what the
       reporter is suggesting in the issue and that they have
       confirmed and reproduced the issue. The next status is
       typically "assigned".
     * Assigned - This status is used to reflect that the issue
       has been assigned to one of the team members and that such
       team member is actively working on the issue. The next
       status is typically "resolved".
     * Resolved - This status is used to reflect that the issue
       has been resolved. An issue can be resolved with one of
       many resolutions (customizable). For example, an issue can
       be resolved as "fixed", "duplicate", "won't fix", "no
       change required", etc. The next statuses are typically
       "closed" or in case of the issue being re-opened, then it
       would be "feedback".
     * Closed - This status reflects that the issue is completely
       closed and no further actions are required on it. It also
       typically hides the issue from the View Issues page. Some
       teams use "closed" to reflect sign-off by the reporter and
       others use it to reflect the fact that the fix has been
       released to customers.
     __________________________________________________________

4.3. Workflow

   Now that we have covered how an issue gets created, and what
   are the different statuses during the life cycle of such
   issues, the next step is to define the workflow. In other
   words, how issues move from one status to another and who has
   access to trigger such transitions. MantisBT provides the
   ability for teams to define their own custom workflow which
   works on top of their custom status. The workflow dictates the
   valid transitions between statuses and the user access level
   required of the user who triggers such transition.
     __________________________________________________________

4.3.1. Workflow Transitions

   This "Manage > Manage Configuration > Workflow Transitions"
   page allows users with ADMINISTRATOR access level to do the
   following tasks.

     * Define the valid next statuses for each status.
     * Define the default next status for each status.
     * Define the minimum access level required for a user to
       transition to each status.
     * Define the default status for newly created issues.
     * Define the status at which the issue is considered
       resolved. Any issues with this status code greater than or
       equal to the specified status will be considered resolved.
     * Define the status which is assigned to issues that are
       re-opened.
     * Define the required access level to change the workflow.

   Note that the scope of the applied change is dependent on the
   selected project. If "All Projects" is selected, then the
   configuration is to be used as the default for all projects,
   unless overidden by a specific project. To configure for a
   specific project, switch to the project via the combobox at the
   top right corner of the screen.
     __________________________________________________________

4.3.2. Workflow Thresholds

   This "Manage > Manage Configuration > Workflow Thresholds" page
   allows users with ADMINISTRATOR access level to define the
   thresholds required to do certain actions. Following is a list
   of such actions and what they mean:

     * Report an issue - The access levels that are allowed to
       report an issue.
     * Update an issue - The access levels that are allowed to
       update the header information of an issue.
     * Allow issue to be closed on resolved - The access levels
       that are allow to resolve and close an issue in one step.
     * Allow reporter to close issue - Indicates if reporters
       should be allowed to close issues reported by them.
     * Monitor an issue - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to monitor an issue. Once a user monitors an issue,
       the user will be included in all future email notifications
       relating to changes in the issue.
     * Handle an issue - The access levels required for a user to
       be shown in the list of users that can handle an issue.
     * Assign an issue - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to change the handler (i.e. assign / unassign) an
       issue.
     * Move an issue - The access levels required for a user to be
       able to move an issue from one project to another. (TODO:
       are these access levels evaluated against source or
       destination project?).
     * Delete an issue - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to delete an issue.
     * Reopen an issue - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to re-open a resolved or closed issue.
     * Allow Reporter to re-open Issue - Whether the reporter of
       an issue can re-open a resolved or closed issue,
       independent of their access level.
     * Status to which a reopened issue is set - This is the
       status to which an issue is set after it is re-opened.
     * Resolution to which a reopen issue is set - The resolution
       to set on issues that are reopened.
     * Status where an issue is considered resolved - The status
       at which an issue is considered resolved.
     * Status where an issue becomes readonly - Issues with such
       status and above are considered read-only. Read-only issues
       can only be modified by users with a configured access
       level. Read-only applies to the issue header information as
       well as other issue related information like relationships,
       attachments, notes, etc.
     * Update readonly issues - The access levels required for a
       user to be able to modify a readonly issue.
     * Update issue status - The access levels required for a user
       to be able to modify the status of an issue.
     * View private issues - The access levels for a user to be
       able to view a private issue.
     * Set view status (public vs. private) - The access level for
       a user to be able to set whether an issue is private or
       public, when reporting the issue. If the user reporting the
       issues doesn't have the required access, then the issue
       will be created with the default view state.
     * Update view status (public vs private) - The access level
       required for a user to be able to update the view status
       (i.e. public vs. private).
     * Show list of users monitoring issue - The access level
       required for a user to be able to view the list of users
       monitoring an issue.
     * Set status on assignment of handler - The access levels
       required for a user to be able to re-assign an issue when
       changing its status.
     * Status to set auto-assigned issues to - The status - This
       is the status that is set on issues that are auto assigned
       to users that are associated with the category that the
       issuer is reported under.
     * Limit reporter's access to their own issues - When set,
       reporters are only allow to view issues that they have
       reported.
     * Add notes - The access levels required for users to be able
       to add notes.
     * Update notes - The access levels required for users to be
       able to update issue notes.
     * Allow user to edit their own issue notes - A flag that
       indicates the ability for users to edit issue notes report
       by them.
     * Delete note - The access levels required for a user to
       delete a note that they may or may not have reported
       themselves.
     * View private notes - The access levels required for a user
       to be able to view private notes associated with an issue
       that they have access to view.
     * View Change Log - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to view the change log.
     * View Assigned To - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to know the handler of an issue that they have
       access to.
     * View Issue History - The access levels required for a user
       to be able to view the history of changes of an issue.
     * Send reminders - The access levels required for a user to
       be able to send reminders to other users relating to an
       issue that they have access to.

Chapter 5. Configuration

5.1. Database

   The database settings must be set in order for the package to
   work properly. These settings should be provided to you by your
   system administrator or your hosting company.

   $g_hostname
          Host name or connection string for Database server. The
          default value is localhost. For MySql, this should be
          hostname or hostname:port (e.g. localhost:3306).

   $g_db_username
          User name to use for connecting to the database. The
          user needs to have read/write access to the MantisBT
          database. The default user name is "root".

   $g_db_password
          Password for the specified user name. The default
          password is empty.

   $g_database_name
          Name of database that contains MantisBT tables. The
          default name is 'bugtracker'.

   $g_db_schema
          The database schema (used in case of DB2), otherwise
          should be left blank.

   $g_db_type
          The supported database types include: 'mysql' or
          'mysqli' for MySQL, 'pgsql' for PostgreSQL, 'mssql' for
          MS SQL Server, 'oci8' for Oracle, and 'db2' for DB2. It
          is important to make sure that the PHP extension
          corresponding to the database type is enabled.
     __________________________________________________________

5.2. Path

   These path settings are important for proper linking within
   MantisBT. In most scenarios the default values should work
   fine, and you should not need to override them.

   $g_path
          URL to your installation as seen from the web browser;
          this is what you type into the URL field. Requires
          trailing '/' character. eg.
          'http://www.example.com/mantisbt/'. In the following
          example https protocol is used: eg.
          'https://www.example.com/mantisbt/'. MantisBT will
          default this to the correct value. However, in some
          cases it might be necessary to override the default.
          This is typically needed when an installation can be
          accessed by multiple URLs (internal vs external).

   $g_icon_path
          This is the URL to the icons (images) directory as seen
          from the web browser. All MantisBT images/icons are
          loaded from this URL. The default value for this URL is
          based on $g_path (i.e. '%path%images/'). Note that a
          trailing '/' is required.

   $g_short_path
          Short web path without the domain name. This requires
          the trailing '/'.

   $g_absolute_path
          This is the absolute file system path to the MantisBT
          installation, it is defaulted to the directory where
          config_defaults_inc.php resides. Requires trailing '/'
          character (eg. '/usr/apache/htdocs/mantisbt/').

   $g_core_path
          This is the path to the core directory of your
          installation. The default value is usually OK, unless
          you move the 'core' directory out of your webroot.
          Requires trailing DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR. character.

   $g_class_path
          This is the path to the classes directory which is a
          sub-directory of core by default. The default value is
          typically OK. Requires trailing DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.
          character.

   $g_manual_url
          This is the url to the MantisBT online manual. Requires
          trailing '/' character.

5.3. Webserver

   $g_use_iis
          Indicates the IIS (Microsoft Internet Information
          Server) is the web server on which MantisBT is hosted.
     __________________________________________________________

5.4. Configuration Settings

   $g_global_settings
          This option contains the list of regular expressions
          that are used to determine if it is allowed for a
          specific configuraiton option to be saved to or loaded
          from the database. Configuration options that matches
          the regular expressions are considered global only and
          hence are only configurable via the config_inc.php file
          and defaulted by config_defaults_inc.php file.
     __________________________________________________________

5.5. Signup and Lost Password

   $g_allow_signup
          Allow users to signup for their own accounts. Default is
          ON.

   $g_max_failed_login_count
          Maximum failing login attempts before the account is
          locked. Once locked, it's required to reset the password
          (lost password). Value resets to zero at each
          successfully login. Default is OFF.

   $g_notify_new_user_created_threshold_min
          The minimum global access level required to be notified
          when a new user registers via the "signup form". To pick
          specific access levels that are not necessarily at the
          higher end of access levels, use an array of access
          levels. Default is ADMINISTRATOR.

   $g_send_reset_password
          When set to ON, MantisBT will email the users their new
          passwords when their accounts are reset. If set to OFF,
          the password will be reset to blank and no e-mail will
          be sent. Default is ON.

5.6. Email

   $g_administrator_email
          The administrator's e-mail address. This is mainly
          prompted to the user in case of errors that might
          require the intervention of the system administrator.
          For example, SQL errors. sysadmin@example.com

   $g_webmaster_email
          The webmaster's e-mail address. This address is
          displayed in the bottom of all MantisBT pages.
          webmaster@example.com

   $g_from_email
          The email address to be used as the source of all emails
          sent by MantisBT. noreply@example.com

   $g_return_path_email
          Email address to receive bounced emails.

   $g_enable_email_notification
          Set to ON to enable email notifications, OFF to disable
          them. Default is ON. Note that disabling email
          notifications has no effect on emails generated as part
          of the user signup process. When set to OFF, the
          password reset feature is disabled. Additionally,
          notifications of administrators updating accounts are
          not sent to users.

   $g_default_notify_flags
          Associated with each action a list of flags to control
          who should be notified.The default will be used if the
          action is not included in $g_notify_flags orif the flag
          is not included in the specific action definition. The
          list of actions include: new, assigned, resolved,
          bugnote, reopened, closed, deleted, feedback.The default
          is: $g_default_notify_flags = array('reporter' => ON,
          'handler' => ON, 'monitor' => ON, 'bugnotes' => ON,
          'explicit' => ON, 'threshold_min' => NOBODY,
          'threshold_max' => NOBODY); threshold_min and
          threshold_max are used to send messages to all members
          of the project whose status is greater than or equal to
          "threshold_min" and less than or equal to
          "threshold_max". Sending messages to everyone would set
          "threshold_min" to ANYBODY and "threshold_max to
          "NOBODY". To send to all DEVELOPERS and above (as
          0.17.5), use DEVELOPER and NOBODY respectively.

   $g_notify_flags
          Defines the notification flags that are different from
          the defaults that are defined in
          $g_default_notify_flags. The following code overrides
          the default by disabling notifications to bugnote
          authors and users monitoring the bug on submitting a new
          bug: $g_notify_flags['new'] = array('bugnotes' => OFF,
          'monitor' => OFF); Available actions include:

          + 'new': a new bug has been added
          + 'reopened': the bug has been reopened
          + 'deleted': a bug has been deleted
          + 'owner': the bug has been assigned a new owner
          + 'bugnote': a bugnote has been added to a bug
          + 'sponsor': the sponsorship for the bug has changed
            (added, deleted or updated)
          + 'relation': a relationship for the bug has changed
            (added, deleted or updated)
          + 'monitor': a user is added to the monitor list.

          In addition, an action can match the bug status in
          $g_status_enum_string. Note that spaces in the string
          are replaced with underscores ('_') in creating the
          action. Thus, using the defaults, 'feedback' would be a
          valid action.

   $g_email_receive_own
          This defines whether users should receive emails for
          their own actions. This option is defaulted to OFF,
          hence, users do not receive email notification for their
          own actions. This can be a source for confusions for
          users upgrading from MantisBT 0.17.x versions, since in
          these versions users used to get notified of their own
          actions.

   $g_validate_email
          Set to OFF to disable email checking. Default is ON.

   $g_check_mx_record
          Set to OFF to disable email checking. Default is OFF.

   $g_allow_blank_email
          If ON, allows the user to omit an email address field.
          If you allow users to create their own accounts, they
          must specify an email at that point, no matter what the
          value of this option is. Otherwise they wouldn't get
          their passwords.

   $g_limit_email_domain
          Only allow and send email to addresses in the given
          domain. This is useful as a security feature and it is
          also useful in cases like Sourceforge where its servers
          are only limited to send emails to SourceForge email
          addresses in order to avoid spam. $g_limit_email_domain
          = 'users.sourceforge.net';

   $g_show_user_email_threshold
          This specifies the access level that is needed to have
          user names hyperlinked with mailto: links. The default
          value is NOBODY, hence, even administrators won't have
          this feature enabled.

   $g_mail_priority
          If use_x_priority is set to ON, what should the value
          be? Urgent = 1, Not Urgent = 5, Disable = 0 . Default is
          3 Some MTAs interpret X-Priority = 0 to mean 'Very
          Urgent'

   $g_phpMailer_method
          Select the method to mail by: PHPMAILER_METHOD_MAIL for
          use of mail() function, PHPMAILER_METHOD_SENDMAIL for
          sendmail (or postfix), PHPMAILER_METHOD_SMTP for SMTP.
          Default is PHPMAILER_METHOD_MAIL.

   $g_smtp_host
          This option specifies the SMTP server to submit messages
          to. The SMTP server (MTA) then takes on the
          responsibility of deliverying such messages to their
          final destinations. To use the local SMTP (if available)
          set this to 'localhost', otherwise use the fully
          qualified domain name of the remote SMTP server. Default
          value is 'localhost'.

   $g_smtp_port
          The smtp port to use. The typical SMTP ports are 25 and
          587. The port to use will depend on the SMTP server
          configuration and hence others may be used. The default
          is 25.

   $g_smtp_connection_mode
          This option allows you to specify the connection mode to
          the SMTP server. Possible values are '', 'ssl', 'tls'.
          The default value is ''.

   $g_smtp_username
          This option allows the use of SMTP Authentication when
          using a remote SMTP host with PHPMailer. If
          smtp_username is not '' then the username and password
          will be used when logging in to the SMTP server. Default
          is ''.

   $g_smtp_password
          This is the password that is used in SMTP Authentication
          . Default is ''.

   $g_email_send_using_cronjob
          TODO

   $g_email_set_category
          Specify whether e-mails should be sent with the category
          set or not. This is tested with Microsoft Outlook. More
          testing for this feature + other formats will be added
          in the future. OFF, EMAIL_CATEGORY_PROJECT_CATEGORY
          (format: [Project] Category). Default is OFF.

   $g_email_separator1
          Default is str_pad('', 70, '='); This means 70 equal
          signs.

   $g_email_separator2
          Default is str_pad('', 70, '-'); This means 70 minus
          signs.

   $g_email_padding_length
          Default is 28.

   MantisBT uses flags and a threshold system to generate emails
   on events. For each new event, email is sent to:

     * the reporter, qualified by the notify flag 'reporter' below
     * the handler (or Assigned to), qualified by the notify flag
       'handler' below
     * anyone monitoring the bug, qualified by the notify flag
       'monitor' below
     * anyone who has ever added a bugnote the bug, qualified by
       the notify flag 'bugnotes' below
     * anyone assigned to the project whose access level is
       greater than or equal to the notify flag 'threshold_min'
       and less than or equal to the notify flag 'threshold_max'
       below

   From this list, those recipients who meet the following
   criteria are eliminated:

     * the originator of the change, if $g_email_receive_own is
       OFF
     * the recipient either no longer exists, or is disabled
     * the recipient has turned their email_on_<new status>
       preference OFF
     * the recipient has no email address extered
     __________________________________________________________

5.7. Version

   $g_show_version
          Whether to show the MantisBT version at the bottom of
          each page or not. Default is ON.
     __________________________________________________________

5.8. Language

   $g_default_language
          This is the language used by default in MantisBT. This
          may be set to 'auto' where MantisBT will try to
          determine the language from the browser.

   $g_language_choices_arr
          This is to be set to an array of languages that are
          available for users to choose from. The default value
          includes all languages supported by MantisBT. The
          administrator can limit the languages available for
          users to choose from by overriding this value. For
          example, to support English, French and German include
          the following code: array( 'english', 'french', 'german'
          ); Of course, administrators can also add their own
          languages by translating the strings and creating their
          own language files. You are encouraged to share any
          translation work that you do with the MantisBT team.
          This will ensure that the newly created language file is
          maintained with future MantisBT releases.All language
          files reside in the lang/ folder. They are all named
          according to the following pattern:
          strings_<language>.txt.

   $g_fallback_language
          This is the language used if MantisBT cannot determine
          the language from the browser. It defaults to
          'english'.As of 0.19.0, this may be set to 'auto' where
          MantisBT will try to determine the language from the
          browser.

   Note

        If a string does not exist in the active language, the English
        string is used instead.
     __________________________________________________________

5.9. Display

   $g_window_title
          This is the browser window title (<TITLE> tag).

   $g_page_title
          This is a heading that is displayed in the viewing area
          of the page.

          (default 'images/mantis_logo.gif').

   $g_logo_url
          The default URL to be associated with the logo. By
          default this is set to $g_default_home_page (which
          defaults to My View page). Clicking on the logo from any
          page in the bug tracker will navigate to the URL
          specified in this configuration option.

   $g_show_footer_menu
          Show the menu at the bottom of the page as well as at
          the top. Default value is OFF.

   $g_show_project_menu_bar
          This option specifies whether to add menu at the top of
          the page which includes links to all the projects. The
          default value is OFF.

   $g_show_assigned_names

   $g_view_issues_page_columns
          This configuration option is used to select the columns
          to be included in the View Issues page and in which
          order. If one of the column is not accessible to the
          logged in user, or corresponds to a disabled feature,
          then it will be automatically removed from the list at
          runtime. Hence, the same column list may show a
          different set of columns based on the logged in user,
          the currently selected project and enabled features
          (e.g. sponsorship_total is only shown if the sponsorship

          status, last_updated, summary, bugnotes_count,
          description, steps_to_reproduce, additional_information.
          As for custom fields they can be referenced by adding a
          'custom_' to their name (e.g. xyz would be custom_xyz).

          By default the following columns are selected:
          selection, edit, priority, id, sponsorship_total,
          bugnotes_count, attachment, category_id, severity,
          status, last_updated, summary.

   $g_print_issues_page_columns
          This configuration option is used to select the columns
          to be included in the Print Issues page and in which
          order. See $g_view_issues_page_columns for more details
          about the supported fields.

          By default the following columns are selected:
          selection, priority, id, sponsorship_total,
          bugnotes_count, attachment, category_id, severity,
          status, last_updated, summary

   $g_csv_columns
          This configuration option is used to select the columns
          to be included in the CSV export and in which order. See
          $g_view_issues_page_columns for more details about the
          supported fields.

          By default the following columns are selected: id,
          project_id, reporter_id, handler_id, priority, severity,
          reproducibility, version, build, projection,
          category_id, date_submitted, eta, os, os_build,
          platform, view_state, last_updated, summary, status,
          resolution, fixed_in_version, duplicate_id.

   $g_excel_columns
          This configuration option is used to select the columns
          to be included in the CSV export and in which order. See
          $g_view_issues_page_columns for more details about the
          supported fields.

          By default the following columns are selected: id,
          project_id, reporter_id, handler_id, priority, severity,
          reproducibility, version, build, projection,
          category_id, date_submitted, eta, os, os_build,

          resolution, fixed_in_version, duplicate_id.

   $g_show_bug_project_links
          Show project links when in All Projects mode. Default is
          ON.

   $g_status_legend_position

   $g_show_attachments_indicator
          In view all bug page, show a clip icon next to bugs that
          has one or more attachments. The default value is OFF.
          The reason why this is defaulted to OFF is that it adds
          an extra query for every bug dispayed in the list.

   $g_show_product_version
          This controls display of the product version in the
          report, view, update and print issue pages. This flag
          also applies to other product version related fields
          like product build, fixed in version, and target
          version. Valid values are ON, OFF, and AUTO. ON for
          always displayed, AUTO for displayed when project has
          versions defined, and OFF for always OFF. The default
          value is AUTO.

   $g_show_version_dates_threshold
          The access level threshold at which users will see the
          date of release for product versions. Dates will be
          shown next to the product version, target version and
          fixed in version fields. Set this threshold to NOBODY to
          disable the feature. Default value is NOBODY.

   $g_show_realname
          This control will replace the user's userid with their
          realname. If it is set to ON, and the real name fiels
          has been populated, the replacement will occur. It
          defaults to OFF.

   $g_show_avatar
          Show user avatar (default OFF); the current
          implementation is based on http://www.gravatar.com,
          users will need to register there with the same email
          address used in this MantisBT installation to have their
          avatar shown.

     Note

          Upon registration or avatar change, it takes some time for the
          updated gravatar images to show on sites.

   $g_show_avatar_threshold
          The threshold of users for which MantisBT should attempt
          to show the avatar (default DEVELOPER). Note that the
          threshold is related to the user for whom the avatar is
          being shown, rather than the user who is currently
          logged in.

   $g_default_avatar
          The full URL to the image to be used when a user doesn't
          have an avatar account.

     __________________________________________________________

5.14. Summary

   These are the settings that are used to configuration options
   related to the Summary page. This page contains statistics
   about the bugs in MantisBT.

   $g_reporter_summary_limit
          Limit how many reporters to show in the summary page.
          This is useful when there are dozens or hundreds of
          reporters. The default value is 10.

   $g_date_partitions
          An array of date lengths to count bugs by (in days) for
          the summary by date. The default is to count for 1, 2,
          3, 7, 30, 60, 90, 180, and 365.

   $g_summary_category_include_project
          Specifies whether category names should be preceeded by
          project names (eg: [Project] Category) when the summary
          page is viewed for all projects. This is useful in the
          case where category names are common accross projects.
          The default is OFF.

   $g_view_summary_threshold
          Specifies the access level required to view the summary
          page. Default is VIEWER.

   $g_severity_multipliers
          An array of multipliers which are used to determine the
          effectiveness of reporters based on the severity of
          bugs. Higher multipliers will result in an increase in
          reporter effectiveness. The default multipliers are:

$g_severity_multipliers = array ( FEATURE => 1,

  TRIVIAL => 2,

  TEXT => 3,

  TWEAK => 2,

  MINOR => 5,

  MAJOR => 8,

  CRASH => 8,

  BLOCK => 10 );

          The keys of the array are severity constants from
          constant_inc.php or from custom_constants_inc.php if you
          have custom severities defined. The values are integers,
          typically in the range of 0 to 10. If you would like for
          a severity to not count towards effectiveness, set the
          value to 0 for that severity.

   $g_resolution_multipliers
          An array of multipliers which are used to determine the
          effectiveness of reporters based on the resolution of
          bugs. Higher multipliers will result in a decrease in
          reporter effectiveness. The only resolutions that need
          to be defined here are those which match or exceed
          $g_bug_resolution_not_fixed_threshold. The default
          multipliers are:

$g_resolution_multipliers = array( UNABLE_TO_DUPLICATE => 2,

   NOT_FIXABLE => 1,

   DUPLICATE => 3,

   NOT_A_BUG => 5,

   SUSPENDED => 1,

   WONT_FIX => 1 );

          The keys of the array are resolution constants from
          constant_inc.php or from custom_constants_inc.php if you
          have custom resolutions defined. Resolutions not
          included here will be assumed to have a multiplier value
          of 0. The values are integers, typically in the range of
          0 to 10. If you would like for a resolution to not count
          towards effectiveness, set the value to 0 for that
          resolution or remove it from the array completely. Note
          that these resolution multipliers are stacked on top of
          the severity multipliers. Therefore by default, a user
          reporting many duplicate bugs at severity level BLOCK
          will be far worse off than a user reporting many
          duplicate bugs at severity level FEATURE.
     __________________________________________________________

5.15. Bugnote

   $g_bugnote_order
          Order to use for sorting bugnotes by submit date.
          Possible values include ASC for ascending and DESC for
          descending order. The default value is ASC.
     __________________________________________________________

5.16. File Upload

   MantisBT allows users to upload file attachements and
   associated them with bugs as well as projects. Bug attachments
   / project documents can be uploaded to the webserver, database,
   or an FTP server. When bugs are uploaded to the webserver they
   are uploaded to the path that is configured in the project
   properties.In case of problems getting the file upload feature
   to work, check the following resources: PHP Manual .

   $g_allow_file_upload
          Whether to allow/disallow uploading of attachments.
          Default value is ON.

   $g_file_upload_method
          Specify the location for uploading attachements. This
          can be DISK, DATABASE, or FTP. In case of FTP, the files
          are saved on the webserver (same as disk) as well as on
          the specified FTP server. Default value is DATABASE. In
          case of DISK / FTP upload methods you need to provide
          the webserver with write access rights to the configured
          upload path (configured in the project) and temporary
          upload path (used by PHP).

   $g_max_file_size
          The maximum file size to allow as an attachment. You may
          also have to configure your php.ini file to increase the
          execution time, memory limit, max post size, and max
          upload size.

   $g_file_upload_ftp_server
          Address of the FTP server to write to (eg:
          ftp.example.com). This option is only effective if
          upload method is FTP.

   $g_file_upload_ftp_user
          FTP user name for account to be used in uploading files
          to the FTP server. This account must have read/write
          access to the FTP server. The default path for the
          account is used for uploading the files.

   $g_file_upload_ftp_pass
          Password to use when loggin in to the FTP server.

   $g_max_file_size
          Maximum file size that can be uploaded. Default value is
          about 5MB. The max file upload size is also affected by
          the value specified in php.ini. The PHP value is usually
          defaulted to 2MB.

   $g_allowed_files
          Files that are allowed. Separate items by commas. eg.
          "zip,bmp,gif,jpg,txt" If $g_allowed_files is filled in
          NO other file types will be allowed. If empty it will
          assume any files are accepted that pass the
          $g_disallowed_files list.

   $g_disallowed_files
          Files that are not allowed. Separate items by commas.
          eg. "php,php3,phtml,html,class,java,exe,pl"
          $g_disallowed_files takes precedence over
          $g_allowed_files. It is recommended to disable all
          extensions that can be executed by your server.

   $g_document_files_prefix
          Prefix to give to uploaded files when saved to the
          upload directory. This is used for documents that are
          attached to projects in order to be able to
          differentiate them from files that are attached to bugs.
          The name of the file has the following format
          prefix-projectcode-filename. The default value is 'doc'.

   $g_preview_attachments_inline_max_size
          This limit applies to previewing of image / text
          attachments. If the attachment size is smaller than the
          specified value, the attachment is previewed with the
          issue details. The previewing can be disabled by setting
          this configuration to 0. The default value is 256 * 1024
          (256KB).

   $g_fileinfo_magic_db_file
          Specify the filename of the magic database file. This is
          used by PHP 5.3.0 (or earlier versions with the fileinfo
          PECL extension) to guess what the MIME type of a file
          is. Usually it is safe to leave this setting as the
          default (blank) as PHP is usually able to find this file
          by itself.
     __________________________________________________________

5.17. HTML

   $g_html_tags
          This is the list of HTML tags that are allowed.Do NOT
          include href or img tags here.Do NOT include tags that
          have parameters (eg. )The HTML code is allowed to enter
          the database as is. The $g_allow_href_tags does not have
          to be enabled to make URL links. The package will
          automatically hyperlink properly formatted URLs eg.
          http://blah.blah/ or mailto://me@more.com/

   $g_hr_size
          hr size.

   $g_hr_width
          hr width. Leave off the percentage (%) symbol.

   $g_bottom_include_page
          If this page eixsts it will be displayed at the bottom
          of every page. It makes a good company branding include
          page.

   $g_top_include_page
          If this page exists it will be displayed at the top of
          every page. It makes a good company branding include
          page.

   $g_css_include_file
          Set this to point to the CSS file of your choice.

   $g_css_rtl_include_file
          Set this to point to the RTL CSS file of your choice.

   $g_meta_include_file
          Set this to point to the META tag file of your choice.

   $g_main_menu_custom_options
          This option will add custom options to the main menu. It
          is an array of arrays listing the caption, access level
          required, and the link to be executed. For example:
          $g_main_menu_custom_options = array( array( "My Link",
          MANAGER, 'my_link.php' ), array( "My Link2",
          ADMINISTRATOR, 'my_link2.php' ) ); Note that if the
          caption is found in custom_strings_inc.php, then it will
          be replaced by the translated string. Options will only
          be added to the menu if the current logged in user has
          the appropriate access level.
     __________________________________________________________

5.18. Authentication

5.18.1. Global authentication parameters

   $g_login_method
          Specifies which method will be used to authenticate. It
          should be one of the following values (defaults to MD5):

          + MD5 - user's password is stored as a hash in the
            database
          + LDAP - authenticates against an LDAP (or Active
            Directory) server
          + BASIC_AUTH
          + HTTP_AUTH

          In addition, the following deprecated values are
          supported for backwards-compatibility, and should no

            in the database
          + CRYPT
          + CRYPT_FULL_SALT

          Note: you may not be able to easily switch encryption
          methods, so this should be carefully chosen at install
          time. However, MantisBT will attempt to "fall back" to
          older methods if possible.

   $g_reauthentication
          Determines whether MantisBT will require the user to
          re-authenticate before granting access to the Admin

          The LDAP field for the user's real name (i.e. common
          name). Defaults to cn.

   $g_use_ldap_realname
          Use the realname specified in LDAP (ON) rather than the
          one stored in the database (OFF). Defaults to OFF.

          Note that MantisBT will update the database with the
          data retrieved from LDAP when ON.

   $g_use_ldap_email
          Use the email address specified in LDAP (ON) rather than
          the one stored in the database (OFF). Defaults to OFF.

          Note that MantisBT will update the database with the
          data retrieved from LDAP when ON.

   $g_ldap_simulation_file_path
          This configuration option allows replacing the ldap
          server with a comma-delimited text file for development
          or testing purposes.

          The LDAP simulation file format is as follows:

              One line per user
              Each line has 4 comma-delimited fields
                  - username,
                  - realname,
                  - e-mail,
                  - password
              Any extra fields are ignored

          On production systems, this option should be set to ''.
          This is the default.

   $g_ldap_port
          Deprecated since MantisBT release 1.2.0a1.

          The LDAP server port number should be defined as part of
          the URI in $g_ldap_server instead (see above).

5.19. Status Settings

   $g_bug_submit_status
          Status to assign to the bug when submitted. Default
          value is NEW_.

   $g_bug_assigned_status
          Status to assign to the bug when assigned. Default value
          is ASSIGNED.

   $g_bug_reopen_status
          Status to assign to the bug when reopened. Default value
          is FEEDBACK.

   $g_bug_feedback_status
          Status to assign to the bug when feedback is required
          from the issue reporter. Once the reporter adds a note
          the status moves back from feedback to
          $g_bug_assigned_status or $g_bug_submit_status based on
          whether the bug assigned or not.

   $g_reassign_on_feedback
          When a note is added to a bug currently in
          $g_bug_feedback_status, and the note author is the bug's
          reporter, this option will automatically set the bug
          status to $g_bug_submit_status or $g_bug_assigned_status
          if the bug is assigned to a developer. Defaults to
          enabled.

   $g_bug_reopen_resolution
          Resolution to assign to the bug when reopened. Default
          value is REOPENED.

   $g_auto_set_status_to_assigned
          Automatically set status to $g_bug_assigned_status
          whenever a bug is assigned to a person. Installations
          where assigned status is to be used when the defect is
          in progress, rather than just put in a person's queue
          should set it to OFF. Default is ON.

   $g_bug_resolved_status_threshold
          Bug is resolved, ready to be closed or reopened. In some
          custom installations a bug maybe considered as resolved
          when it is moved to a custom (FIXED OR TESTED) status.

   $g_bug_resolution_fixed_threshold
          Threshold resolution which denotes that a bug has been
          resolved and successfully fixed by developers.
          Resolutions above this threshold and below
          $g_bug_resolution_not_fixed_threshold are considered to
          be resolved successfully. Default value is FIXED.

   $g_bug_resolution_not_fixed_threshold
          Threshold resolution which denotes that a bug has been
          resolved without being successfully fixed by developers.
          Resolutions above this threshold are considered to be
          resolved in an unsuccessful way. Default value is
          UNABLE_TO_DUPLICATE.

   $g_bug_readonly_status_threshold
          $g_update_readonly_bug_threshold
          Bug becomes readonly if its status is >=
          $g_bug_readonly_status_threshold. The bug becomes
          read/write again if re-opened and its status becomes
          less than this threshold. The default is RESOLVED. Once
          the bug becomes readonly, a user with an access level
          greater than or equal to
          $g_update_readonly_bug_threshold can still edit the bug.

   $g_status_enum_workflow
          'status_enum_workflow' defines the workflow, and
          reflects a simple 2-dimensional matrix. For each
          existing status, you define which statuses you can go to
          from that status, e.g. from NEW_ you might list statuses
          '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged' but not higher
          ones.The default is no workflow, where all states are
          accessible from any others.

   $g_report_bug_threshold
          This is the access level required to open a bug. The
          default is REPORTER.

   $g_update_bug_threshold
          This is the access level generally required to update
          the content of a bug. The default is UPDATER.

   $g_handle_bug_threshold
          This is the access level generally required to be access
          level needed to be listed in the assign to field. The
          default is DEVELOPER. If a more restrictive setting can
          be determined from $g_set_status_threshold, it will be
          used.

   $g_update_bug_status_threshold $g_set_status_threshold
          These settings control the access level required to
          promote a bug to a new status once the bug is
          opened.$g_set_status_threshold is an array indexed by
          the status value that allows a distinct setting for each
          status. It defaults to blank.If the appropriate status
          is not defined above, $g_update_bug_status_threshold is
          used instead. The default is DEVELOPER.

   $g_allow_close_immediately
          If set, bugs are allowed to be resolved and closed in
          one action. The default is OFF.

   $g_allow_reporter_close
          If set, the bug reporter is allowed to close their own
          bugs, regardless of their access level. The default is
          OFF.

   $g_allow_reporter_reopen
          If set, the bug reporter is allowed to reopen their own
          bugs once resolved, regardless of their access level.
          This allows the reporter to disagree with the
          resolution. The default is ON.

     __________________________________________________________

5.20. Filters

   $g_filter_by_custom_fields
          Show custom fields in the filter dialog and use these in
          filtering. Defaults to ON.

   $g_filter_custom_fields_per_row
          The number of custom fields to display per row. The
          default is 7. The value should be greater than or equal
          to 7.

   $g_view_filters = SIMPLE_DEFAULT;
          Controls the display of the filter pages. Possible
          values are:

          + SIMPLE_ONLY - only simple view
          + ADVANCED_ONLY - only advanced view (allows multiple
            value selections)
          + SIMPLE_DEFAULT - defaults to simple view, but shows a
            link for advanced
          + ADVANCED_DEFAULT - defaults to advanced view, but
            shows a link for simple

   $g_dhtml_filters = OFF;
          Controls the use of DHTML filters that will display the
          filter in view page using DHTML and javascript. Default
          is OFF. This requires $g_use_javascript to ne set to ON.
          This may not work in all browsers as it requires
          xmlhttprequest functionality.

   $g_create_permalink_threshold
          The threshold required for users to be able to create
          permalinks (default DEVELOPER). To turn this feature off
          use NOBODY.

   $g_create_short_url
          The service to use to create a short URL. The %s will be
          replaced by the long URL. By default http://www.tinyurl
          service is used to shorten URLs.
     __________________________________________________________

5.21. Misc

   $g_user_login_valid_regex
          The regular expression to use when validating new user
          login names. The default regular expression allows a-z,
          A-Z, 0-9, +, -, dot, space and underscore. If you change
          this, you may want to update the ERROR_USER_NAME_INVALID
          string in the language files to explain the rules you
          are using on your site.

          See Wikipedia for more details about regular
          expressions. For testing regular expressions, use
          Rubular.

   $g_monitor_bug_threshold
          Access level needed to monitor bugs. The default value
          is REPORTER.

   $g_monitor_add_others_bug_threshold
          Access level needed to add other users to the list of
          users monitoring a bug. The default value is DEVELOPER.

   $g_monitor_delete_others_bug_threshold
          Access level needed to delete other users from the list
          of users monitoring a bug. The default value is
          DEVELOPER.

   $g_limit_reporters
          Limit reporters to only viewing bugs that they report.

   $g_allow_reporter_close
          Allow reporters to close the bugs they reported.

   $g_allow_close_immediately
          Allow developers and above to close bugs immediately
          when resolving bugs.

   $g_allow_bug_delete_access_level
          Allow the specified access level and above to delete
          bugs.

   $g_bug_move_access_level
          Allow the specified access level and above to move bugs
          between projects.

   $g_allow_account_delete
          Allow users to delete their own accounts.

   $g_allow_anonymous_login
          Enable anonymous access to Mantis. You must also specify
          $g_anonymous_account as the account which anonymous
          users will browse Mantis with. The default setting is
          OFF.

   $g_anonymous_account
          Define the account which anonymous users will assume
          when using Mantis. This account is considered by Mantis
          to be protected from modification. In other words, this
          account can only be modified by users with an access
          level equal to or higher than $g_manage_user_threshold.
          Anonymous users will not be able to adjust preferences
          or change account settings like normal users can.

          You will need to create a new account to use for this
          $g_anonymous_account setting. When creating the account
          you should specify a password, email address and so
          forth in the same way you'd create any other account. It
          is suggested that the access level for this account be
          set to VIEWER or some other read only level.

          The anonymous user account will not receive standard
          notifications and can not monitor issues.

          The default setting is blank/undefined. You only need to
          define this setting when $g_allow_anonymous_login is set
          to ON.

   $g_cvs_web
          This allows for quick linking to CVS files via CVSweb or
          ViewCVS.

   $g_bug_link_tag
          If a number follows this tag it will create a link to a
          bug. eg. for # a link would be #45 eg. for bug: a link
          would be bug:98

   $g_show_timer
          Time page loads. Shows at the bottom of the page.

   $g_show_queries_count
          Shows the total number/unique number of queries executed
          to serve the page. Default is ON.

   $g_show_queries_list
          Shows the list of all queries that are executed in
          chronological order from top to bottom. This option is
          only effective when $g_show_queries_count is ON. Default
          is OFF. WARNING: Potential security hazard. Only turn
          this on when you really need it (for debugging or
          profiling)

   $g_register_globals
          If your register_globals is Off then set this to OFF.
          Check your register_globals setting in php.ini or
          phpinfo().

   $g_enable_project_documentation
          Specifies whether to enable support for project
          documents or not. Default is OFF. This feature is
          deprecated and is expected to be moved to a plugin in
          the future.

   $g_admin_site_threshold
          Threshold at which a user is considered to be a site
          administrator. These users have the highest level of
          access to your Mantis installation. This access level is
          required to change key Mantis settings (such as server
          paths) and perform other administrative duties. You may
          need to change this value from the default of
          ADMINISTRATOR if you have defined a new access level to
          replace the default ADMINISTRATOR level in
          constant_inc.php.

 Warning

         This is a potentially dangerous configuration option. Users at
         or above this threshold value will have permission to all
         aspects of Mantis including the admin/ directory. With this
         access level, users can damage your installation of Mantis,
         destroy your database or have elevated access to your server.
         DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
         DOING. BE VERY CAREFUL WITH CHANGING THIS CONFIGURATION VALUE
         FROM THE DEFAULT SETTING.

   $g_view_configuration_threshold
          Threshold for users to view the raw system
          configurations as stored in the database. The default
          value is ADMINISTRATOR.

   $g_set_configuration_threshold
          Threshold for users to set the system configurations
          generically via MantisBT web interface. WARNING: Users
          who have access to set configuration via the interface
          MUST be trusted. This is due to the fact that such users
          can set configurations to PHP code and hence there can
          be a security risk if such users are not trusted. The
          default value is ADMINISTRATOR.
     __________________________________________________________

5.22. Cookies

   The configuration variables $g_string_cookie,
   $g_project_cookie, $g_view_all_cookie, $g_manage_cookie are
   calculated based on $g_cookie_prefix. When you change the
   cookie prefix in config_inc.php, you need to follow it with a
   copy of the four lines that calculate the names for these
   cookies.

   $g_cookie_path
          This is specifies to the path under which a cookie is
          visible. All scripts in this directory and its
          sub-directories will be able to access MantisBT cookies.
          Default value is '/'. It is recommended to set this to
          the actual MantisBT path.

   $g_cookie_domain
          Unused

   $g_cookie_version
          Cookie version is used as a prefix for cookies that
          should be expire when the code is changed in a certain
          way. The developers would increase this version when
          necessary, which in effect will cause the creation of
          new cookies that are compatible with the new code. It is
          not expected for the user to need to change this
          setting.

   $g_cookie_prefix
          This should be set to a unique identifier which does not
          include spaces or periods. Again, this should be unique
          per MantisBT installation, especially if $g_cookie_path
          is not restricting the cookies scope to the actual
          MantisBT directory.
     __________________________________________________________

5.23. Database Tables

   MantisBT enables users to configure a table prefix for all its
   tables. This is useful to be able to have multiple MantisBT
   installation in the same database. The advantage of that is for
   users who are limited by their ISP to have one database.

   $g_db_table_prefix
          Specifies the prefix to be use for all table names. The
          default value is 'mantis'. If you override the default
          prefix, make sure to update doc/db_generate.sql file
          before generating your database. The other option is to
          import db_generate.sql as is, then rename the tables to
          match the new prefix.

          The prefix is used to help make sure table names are
          unique. This is useful for users who are limited to one
          database.

     Note

          The table name for each of the tables is stored in a variable
          which is calculated based on this configuration option. If you
          change the prefix you have to make sure these variables are
          re-calculated (by adding these calculation statements to
          config_inc.php after assigning the new prefix). An example of
          these variables is: $g_mantis_bug_file_table
     __________________________________________________________

5.24. Speed Optimisation

   $g_compress_html
          This option is used to enable buffering/compression of
          HTML output if the user's browser supports it. Default
          value is ON. This option will be ignored in the
          following scenarios:

          + If php.ini has zlib.output_compression enabled.
          + If php.ini has output_handler set to a handler.
          + If PHP does not include the zlib extension (PHP 4.3.0
            and later include zlib extension by default).

          You can check the loaded modules in your PHP by running
          "php -m" on the command line, or by using php_info()
          command in a php script.

   $g_use_persistent_connections
          Use persistent database connections, setting this to ON
          will open the database once per connection, rather than
          once per page. There might be some scalability issues
          here and that is why it is defaulted to OFF.
     __________________________________________________________

5.25. Reminders

   Sending reminders is a feature where a user can notify / remind
   other users about a bug. In the past, only selected users like
   the managers, or developers would get notified about bugs.
   However, these people can not invite other people (through
   MantisBT) to look at or monitor these bugs.

   This feature is useful if the Manager needs to get feedback
   from testers / requirements team about a certain bug. It avoid
   needing this person to do this manual outside MantisBT. It also
   records the history of such reminders.

   $g_store_reminders
          Specifies if reminders should be stored as bugnotes. The
          bugnote will still reflect that it is a reminder and
          list the names of users that got it. Default is ON.

   $g_reminder_recipients_monitor_bug
          Specifies if users who receive reminders about a bug,
          should be automatically added to the monitor list of
          that bug. Default is ON.
     __________________________________________________________

5.26. Bug History

   Bug history is a feature where MantisBT tracks all
   modifications that are made to bugs. These include everything
   starting from its creation, till it is closed. For each change,
   the bug history will record the time stamp, user who made the
   change, field that changed, old value, and new value.

   Independent of the these settings, MantisBT will always track
   the changes to a bug and add them to its history.

   $g_history_default_visible
          Make the bug history visible by default. If this option
          is not enabled, then the user will have to click on the
          Bug History link to see the bug history. Default is ON.

   $g_history_order
          Show bug history entries in ascending or descending
          order. Default value is 'ASC'.
     __________________________________________________________

5.27. Sponsorship

   $g_enable_sponsorship
          enable/disable the whole issue sponsorship feature. The
          default os OFF.

   $g_sponsorship_currency
          The currency string used for all sponsorships. The
          default is 'US$'.

   $g_minimum_sponsorship_amount
          The minimum sponsorship amount that can be entered. If
          the user enters a value less than this, an error will be
          flagged. The default is 5.

   $g_view_sponsorship_total_threshold
          The access level threshold needed to view the total
          sponsorship for an issue by all users. The default is
          VIEWER.

   $g_view_sponsorship_details_threshold
          The access level threshold needed to view the details of
          the sponsorship (i.e., who will donate what) for an
          issue by all users. The default is VIEWER.

   $g_sponsor_threshold
          The access level threshold needed to allow user to
          sponsor issues. The default is REPORTER. Note that
          sponsoring user must have their email set in their
          profile.

   $g_handle_sponsored_bugs_threshold
          The access level required to be able to handle sponsored
          issues. The default is DEVELOPER.

   $g_assign_sponsored_bugs_threshold
          The access level required to be able to assign a
          sponsored issue to a user with access level greater or
          equal to 'handle_sponsored_bugs_threshold'. The default
          is MANAGER.
     __________________________________________________________

5.28. Source Control Integration

   $g_source_control_account
          Account to be used by the source control script. The
          account must be enabled and must have the appropriate
          access level to add notes to all issues even private
          ones (DEVELOPER access recommended). The default is ''
          (not set).

   $g_source_control_notes_view_status
          This sets whether the note added will be public or
          private (VS_PUBLIC or VS_PRIVATE). For open source
          projects it is expected that the notes be public,
          however, for non-open source it will probably be
          VS_PRIVATE. The default is VS_PRIVATE.

          dependencies, change to 'vertical'. Default is
          'horizontal'.

   $g_relationship_graph_max_depth
          Max depth for relation graphs. This only affects
          relationship graphs, dependency graphs are drawn to the

   $g_relationship_graph_view_on_click
          If set to ON, clicking on an issue on the relationship
          graph will open the bug view page for that issue,
          otherwise, will navigate to the relationship graph for
          that issue.

   $g_dot_tool
          The full path for the dot tool. The webserver must have
          execute permission to this program in order to generate
          relationship graphs. This configuration option is not
          relevant for Windows. The default value is
          '/usr/bin/dot'.

   $g_neato_tool
          The full path for the neato tool. The webserver must
          have execute permission to this program in order to

          combo box at the top right to select the
          project/sub-project. If ON, there will be two. The
          default is OFF.

   $g_subprojects_inherit_versions
          Whether sub-projects should inherit versions from parent
          projects. For project X which is a sub-project of A and
          B, it will have versions from X, A and B. The default
          value is ON.

   $g_subprojects_inherit_categories
          Whether sub-projects should inherit categories from
          parent projects. For project X which is a sub-project of
          A and B, it will have categories from X, A and B. The

5.34. System Logging

   The system logging interface is used to extract detailed
   debugging information for the MantisBT system. It can also
   serve as an audit trail for user actions.

   $g_log_level
          This controls the type of logging information recorded.
          Possible values include:

        LOG_EMAIL
                logs issue id, message type and recipients for all
                emails sent

        LOG_EMAIL_RECIPIENT
                logs the details of email recipient determination.
                Each user id is listed as well as why they are
                added, or deleted from the recipient list

   $g_log_destination
          specifies the file where the log data goes. This file
          must be writable by the web server userid running
          MantisBT. Right now, only "file:<file path>" is
          supported. For example, $g_log_destination =
          'file:/tmp/mantis_log'; See http://www.php.net/error_log
          for details.
     __________________________________________________________

5.35. Time Tracking

   $g_time_tracking_enabled
          Turns Time Tracking features ON or OFF - Default is OFF

   $g_time_tracking_without_note
          Allow time tracking to be recorded without writing some
          text in the associated bugnote - Default is ON

   $g_time_tracking_with_billing
          Adds calculation links to workout how much time has been
          spent between a particular time frame. Currently it will
          allow you to enter a cost/hour and will work out some
          billing information. This will become more extensive in
          the future. Currently it is more of a proof of concept.

   $g_time_tracking_stopwatch
          Instead of a text field turning this option on places a
          stopwatch on the page with Start/Stop and Reset buttons
          next to it. You must have $g_use_javascript switched on
          for this to take effect. A bit gimickie, but who cares.

   $g_time_tracking_view_threshold
          Access level required to view time tracking information
          - Default DEVELOPER.

   $g_time_tracking_edit_threshold
          Access level required to add/edit time tracking
          information (If you give a user
          $g_time_tracking_edit_threshold you must give them
          $g_time_tracking_view_threshold aswell) - Default
          DEVELOPER.

   $g_time_tracking_reporting_threshold
          Access level required to run reports (not completed yet)
          - Default MANAGER.

Chapter 6. Page descriptions

6.1. Login page

   Just enter your username and password and hit the login button.
   There is also a Save Login checkbox to have the package
   remember that you are logged in between browser sessions. You
   will have to have cookies enabled to login.If the account
   doesn't exist, the account is disabled, or the password is
   incorrect then you will remain at the login page. An error
   message will be displayed.The administrator may allow users to
   sign up for their own accounts. If so, a link to Signup for
   your own account will be available.The administrator may also
   have annonymous login allowed. Annonymous users will be logged
   in under a common account.You will be allowed to select a
   project to work in after logging in. You can make a project
   your default selection from the Select Project screen or from
   your Account Options.SignupHere you can signup for a new
   account. You must supply a valid email address and select a
   unique username. Your randomly generated password will be
   emailed to your email account. If MantisBT is setup so that the
   email password is not to be emailed, newly generated accounts
   will have an empty password.
     __________________________________________________________

6.2. Main page

   This is the first page you see upon logging in. It shows you
   the latest news updates for the bugtracker. This is a simple
   news module (based off of work by Scott Roberts) and is to keep
   users abreast of changes in the bugtracker or project. Some
   news postings are specific to projects and others are global
   across the entire bugtracker. This is set at the time of
   posting in the Edit News section.The number of news posts is
   controlled by a global variable. When the number of posts is
   more than the limit, a link to show "older news" is displayed
   at the bottom. Similarly a "newer news" is displayed when you
   have clicked on "older news".There is an Archives option at the
   bottom of the page to view all listings.ArchivesA
   title/date/poster listing of ALL past news articles will be
   listed here. Clicking on the link will bring up the specified
   article. This listing will also only display items that are
   either global or specific to the selected project.
     __________________________________________________________

6.3. View Issues page

   Here we can view the issue listings. The page has a set of
   viewing filters at the top and the issues are listed
   below.FiltersThe filters control the behavior of the issues
   list. The filters are saved between browsing sessions but do
   not currently save sort order or direction.If the number of
   issues exceeds the "Show" count in the filter a set of
   navigation to go to "First", "Last", "Previous", "Next" and
   specific page numbers are added.The Search field will look for
   simple keyword matches in the summary, description, steps to
   reproduce, additional information, issue id, or issue text id
   fields. It does not search through issue notes. Issue List -
   The issues are listed in a table and the attributes are listed
   in the following order: priority, id, number of issue notes,
   category, severity, status, last updated, and summary. Each
   (except for number of issue notes) can be clicked on to sort by
   that column. Clicking again will reverse the direction of the
   sort. The default is to sort by last modification time, where
   the last modified issue appears at the top. The issue id is a
   link that leads to a more detailed report about the issue. You
   can also add issue notes here. The number in the issue note
   count column will be bold if an issue note has been added in
   the specified time frame. The addition of an issue note will
   make the issue note link of the issue appear in the unvisited
   state. The text in the "Severity" column will be bold if the
   severity is major, crash, or block and the issue not resolved.
   The text in the "Updated" column will be bold if the issue has
   changed in the last "Changed(hrs)" field which is specified in
   the viewing filters. Each table row is color coded according to
   the issue status. The colors can be customised through MantisBT
   Configuration .Severitiesblock - prevents further work/progress
   from being made crash - crashes the application or blocking,
   major - major issue, minor - minor issue, tweak - needs
   tweaking, text - error in the text, trivial - being nit picky,
   feature - requesting new feature - Status new - new issue,
   feedback - issue requires more information from reporter,
   acknowledged - issue has been looked at but not confirmed or
   assigned, confirmed - confirmed and reproducible (typically set
   by an Updater or other Developer), assigned - assigned to a
   Developer, resolved - issue should be fixed, waiting on
   confirmation of fix, closed - issue is closed, Moving the mouse
   over the status text will show the resolution as a title. This
   is rendered by some browsers as a bubble and in others as a
   status line text.
     __________________________________________________________

6.4. Issue View page

   Here is the simple listing of the issue report. Most of the
   fields are self-explanatory. "Assigned To" will contain the
   developer assigned to handle the issue. Priority is fully
   functional but currently does nothing of importance. Duplicate
   ID is used when an issue is a duplicate of another. It links to
   the duplicate issue which allows users to read up on the
   original issue report. Below the issue report is a set of
   buttons that a user can select to work on the issue.

     * Update Issue - brings up a page to edit all aspects of the
       issue
     * Assign to - in conjunction with the dropdown list next top
       the button, this is a shortcut to change the assignment of
       an issue
     * Change Status to - in conjunction with the dropdown list
       next top the button, this is a shortcut to change the
       status of an issue. Another page (Change Status) will be
       presented to allow the user to add notes or change relevant
       information
     * Monitor / Unmonitor Issue - allows the user to monitor any
       additions to the issue by email
     * Create Clone - create a copy of the current issue. This
       presents the user with a new issue reporting form with all
       of the information in the current issue filled in. Upon
       submission, a new issue, related to the current issue, will
       be created.
     * Reopen Issue - Allows the user to re-open a resolved issue
     * Move Issue - allows the user to move the issue to another
       project
     * Delete Issue - Allows the user to delete the issue
       permanently. It is recommended against deleting issues
       unless the entry is frivolous. Instead issues should be set
       to resolved and an appropriate resolution category chosen.

   A panel is provided to view and update the sponsorship of an
   issue.Another panel is provided to view, delete and add
   relationships for an issue. Issues can have a parent/child
   relationship, where the user is warned about resolving a parent
   issue before all of the children are resolved. A peer
   relationship is also possible.Below this, there may be a form
   for uploading file attachments. The Administrator needs to
   configure the bugtracker to handle file uploads. If uploading
   to disk is selected, each project needs to set its own upload
   path. Issue notes are shown at the bottom of the issue report.
   A panel to add issue notes is also shown.
     __________________________________________________________

6.5. Issue Change Status page

   This page is used to change the status of an issue. A user can
   add an issue note to describe the reason for change.In
   addition, the following fields may be displayed for update:

     * Resolution and Duplicate ID - for issues being resolved or
       closed
     * Issue Handler (Assigned to)
     * any Custom Fields that are to be visible on update or
       resolution
     * Fixed in Version - for issues being resolved
     * Close Immediately - to immediately close a resolved issue
     __________________________________________________________

6.6. Issue Edit page

   The layout of this page resemples the Simple Issue View page,
   but here you can update various issue fields. The Reporter,
   Category, Severity, and Reproducibility fields are editable but
   shouldn't be unless there is a gross mis-categorization.Also
   modifiable are the Assigned To, Priority, Projection, ETA,
   Resolution, and Duplicate ID fields.As per version 0.18.0, the
   user can also add an issue note as part of an issue update.
     __________________________________________________________

6.7. My Account Page

   This page changes user alterable parameters for the system.
   These selections are user specific.My AccountThis allows the
   user to change their password, screen name, and email address.
   It also reports the user's access levels on the current and
   other projects.
     __________________________________________________________

6.8. System Management Pages

   A number of pages exist under the "Manage" link. These will
   only be visible to those who have an appropriate access level.
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.1. Manage Users

   This page allow an administrator to manage the users in the
   system.It essentially supplies a list of users defined in the
   system. The user names are linked to a page where you can
   change the user's name, access level, and projects to which
   they are assigned. You can also reset their passwords through
   this page.At the top, there is also a list of new users (who
   have created an account in the last week), and accounts where
   the user has yet to log in.New users are created using the
   "Create User" link above the list of existing users. Note that
   the username must be unique in the system. Further, note that
   the user's real name (as displayed on the screen) cannot match
   another user's user name.
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.2. Manage Projects Page

   This page allows the user to manage the projects listed in the
   system.Each project is listed along with a link to manage that
   specific project. The specific project pages allow the user to
   change:

     * the project name
     * the project description
     * its status
     * whether the project is public or private. Private projects
       are only visible to users who are assigned to it or users
       who have the access level to automatically have access to
       private projects (eg: administrators).
     * afile directory used to store attachments for issues and
       documents associated with the project. This folder is
       located on the webserver, it can be absolute path or path
       relative to the main MantisBT folder. Note that this is
       only used if the files are stored on disk or via FTP. In
       case of FTP, the cached version that is saved on the
       webserver, is stored in the specified path.
     * common subprojects. These are other projects who can be
       considered a sub-project of this one. They can be shared
       amongst multiple projects. For example, a "documentation"
       project may be shared amongst several development projects.
     * project categories. These are used to sub-divide the issues
       stored in the system.
     * project versions. These are used to create ChangeLog
       reports and can be used to filter issues. They are used for
       both the Found In and Fixed In versions.
     * Custom Fields linked to this project
     * Users linked to this project. Here is the place where a
       user's access level may be upgraded or downgraded depending
       on their particular role in the project.

6.8.3. Manage Custom Fields

   This page is the base point for managing custom fields. It
   lists the custom fields defined in the system. There is also a
   place to enter a new field name to create a new field.The
   "Edit" links take you to a page where you can define the
   details of a custom field. These include it's name, type,
   value, and display information. On the edit page, the following
   information is defined to control the custom field:

     * name
     * type. Possible values are listed below.
     * Value constraints (Possible values, default value, regular
       expression, minimum length, maximum length).
     * Access (who can read and write the field based on their
       access level).
     * Display control (where the field will show up and must be
       filled in

   All fields are compared in length to be greater than or equal
   to the minimum length, and less than or equal to the manimum
   length, unless these values are 0. If the values are 0, the
   check is skipped. All fields are also compared against the
   regular expression. If the value matches the expression, then
   the value is stored. For example, the expression
   "/^-?([0-9])*$/" can be used to constrain an integer.The table
   below describes the field types and the value constraints.

   Type Field Contents Value Constraints
   String text string up to 255 characters
   Numeric an integer
   Float a floating point number
   Enumeration one of a list of text strings Enter the list of
   text strings separated by "|" (pipe character) in the Possible
   Values field. The Default value should match one of these
   strings as well. This will be displayed as a dropdown menu.
   Email an email address string up to 255 characters When
   displayed, the value will also be encapsulated in a mailto:
   reference.
   Checkbox zero or more of a list of text strings Enter the list
   of text strings separated by "|" (pipe character) in the
   Possible Values field. The Default value should match one of
   these strings as well. This will be displayed as a list of text
   strings with a checkbox beside them.
   List one of a list of text strings Enter the list of text
   strings separated by "|" (pipe character) in the Possible
   Values field. The Default value should match one of these
   strings as well. This will be displayed as a multi-line
   dropdown menu.
   Multiselection List zero or more of a list of text strings
   Enter the list of text strings separated by "|" (pipe
   character) in the Possible Values field. The Default value
   should match one of these strings as well. This will be
   displayed as a multi-line dropdown menu.
   Date text string defining a date This is displayed as a set of
   dropdown menus for day, month, and year. Defaults should be
   defined in yyyy-mm-dd format.

   The display entries are used as follows:

   Entry Meaning
   Display Only On Advanced Page If checked, the field will NOT be
   shown on the simple issue displays
   Display When Reporting Issues If checked, the field will be
   shown on the report issues displays
   Display When Updating Issues If checked, the field will NOT be
   shown on the update issue and change status displays
   Display When Resolving Issues If checked, the field will NOT be
   shown on the update issue displays and change status displays,
   if the new status is resolved.
   Display When Closing Issues If checked, the field will NOT be
   shown on the update issue displays and change status displays,
   if the new status is closed.
   Required On Report If checked, the field must be filled in on
   the issue reports.
   Required On Update If checked, the field must be filled in on
   the update issue and change status displays.
   Required On Resolve If checked, the field must be filled in on
   the update issue and change status displays, if the new status
   is resolved.
   Required On Close If checked, the field must be filled in on
   the update issue and change status displays, if the new status
   is closed.

   Notes on Display

     * Be careful not to set both a required attribute and show
       only on advanced display. It may be possible to trigger a
       validation error that the user cannot recover from (i.e.,
       field is not filled in).
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.4. Manage Global Profiles

   This page allows the definition of global profiles accessible
   to all users of the system. It is similar to the user
   definition of a profile consisting of Platform, OS and Version.
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.5. Manage Configuration

   This set of pages control the configuration of the MantisBT
   system. Note that the configuration items displayed may be on a
   project by project basis.These pages serve two purposes. First,
   they will display the settings for the particular aspects of
   the system. If authorized, they will allow a user to change the
   parameters. They also have settings for what access level is
   required to change these settings ON A PROJECT basis. In
   general, this should be left alone, but administrators may want
   to delegate some of these settings to managers.
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.5.1. Workflow Thresholds

   This page covers the adjustment of the settings for many of the
   workflow related parameters. For most of these, the fields are
   self explanatory and relate to a similarly named setting in the
   configuration file. At the right of each row is a selector that
   allows the administrator to lower the access level required to
   change the particular parameter.The values changeable on this
   page are:

                                                  reminder
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.5.2. Workflow Transitions

   This page covers the status workflow. For most of these, the
   fields are self explanatory and relate to a similarly named
   setting in the configuration file. At the right of each row is
   a selector that allows the administrator to lower the access
   level required to change the particular parameter.The values
   changeable on this page are:

   Table 6-1. Issues
   Title Variable Description
   Status to which a new issue is set $g_bug_submit_status status
   issue is set to when submitted
   Status where an issue is considered resolved
   $g_bug_resolved_status_threshold status where issue is resolved
   Status to which a reopened Issue is set $g_bug_reopen_status
   status issue is set to when reopened

   The matrix that follows has checkmarks where the transitions
   are allowed from the status on the left edge to the status
   listed across the top. This corresponds to the $g_enum_workflow
   array.At the bottom, there is a list of access levels that are
   required to change the status to the value listed across the
   top. This can be used, for instance, to restrict those who can
   close an issue to a specific level, say a manager. This
   corresponds to the $g_set_status_threshold array and the
   $g_report_bug_threshold setting.
     __________________________________________________________

6.8.5.3. Email Notifications

   This page sets the system defaults for sending emails on issue
   related events. MantisBT uses flags and a threshold system to
   generate emails on events. For each new event, email is sent
   to:

     * the reporter
     * the handler (or Assigned to)
     * anyone monitoring the issue
     * anyone who has ever added a issue note the issue
     * anyone assigned to the project whose access level matches a
       range

   From this list, those recipients who meet the following
   criteria are eliminated:

     * the originator of the change, if $g_email_receive_own is
       OFF
     * the recipient either no longer exists, or is disabled
     * the recipient has turned their email_on_<new status>
       preference OFF
     * the recipient has no email address extered

   The matrix on this page selects who will receive messages for
   each of the events listed down the left hand side. The first
   four columns correspond to the first four points listed above.
   The next columns correspond to the access levels defined. Note
   that because a minimum and maximum threshold are used, a
   discontinuous selection is not allowed.
     __________________________________________________________

6.9. Monitor Issue

   The monitor issues feature allows users to subscribe to certain
   issues and hence get copied on all notification emails that are
   sent for these issues.Depending on the configuration, sending a
   reminder to a user about an issue can add this issue to the
   user's list of monitored issues. Users who reported the issue
   or are assigned the issue typically don't need to monitor the
   issue to get the notifications. This is because by default they
   get notified on changes related to the issue anyway. However,
   administrators can change the configuration to disable
   notifications to reporters or handlers in specific scenarios.
     __________________________________________________________

6.10. Reopen Issue

   Re-open issue button is visible in the issue view pages if the
   user has the appropriate access level and the issue is
   resolved/closed. Re-opening a issue will allow users to enter
   issue notes for the re-opening reason. The issue will
   automatically be put into the Feedback status.
     __________________________________________________________

6.11. Delete Issue

   The delete issues button appears on the issue view pages for
   the users who have the appropriate access level. This allows
   you to delete an existing issue. This should only be used on
   frivolous or test issues. A confirmation screen will prompt you
   if you really want to delete the issue. Updaters, Developers,
   Managers, and Administrators can remove issues (you can also
   configure this).
     __________________________________________________________

6.12. Close Issue

   This is a button that appears on the issue view pages for users
   that are authorized to close issues. Depending on the
   configuration, users may be able to close issues without having
   to resolve them first, or may be able to only close resolved
   issues. After the button is clicked, the user is redirected to
   a page where an issue note maybe added.
     __________________________________________________________

6.13. Assign to Me

   This button appears in the issue view pages in case of users
   with access level that is equal to handle_bug_threshold or
   higher. When this button is clicked the issue is assigned to
   the user.
     __________________________________________________________

6.14. Resolve Issue

   This option on the View Issues page allows you to resolve the
   issue. It will lead you to a page where you can set the
   resolution state and a duplicate id (if applicable). After
   choosing that the user can choose to enter an issue note
   detailing the reason for the closure. The issue is then set to
   the Resolved state. The reporter should check off on the issue
   by using the Close Issue button.
     __________________________________________________________

6.15. News Syndication

   MantisBT supports news syndication using RSS v2.0 protocol.
   MantisBT also supports authenticated news feeds for private
   projects or installations where anonymous access is not
   enabled. Authenticated feeds takes a user name and a key token
   that are used to authenticate the user and generate the feed
   results in the context of the user's access rights (i.e. the
   same as what the user would see if they were to logged into
   MantisBT).To get access to the News RSS as anonymous user,
   visit the following
   page: http://www.example.com/mantisbt/news_rss.php While a user
   is logged in, the RSS links provided in the UI will always
   provide links to the authenticated feeds, if no user is logged
   in (i.e. anonymous), then anonymous links will be provided.

Chapter 7. Customizing MantisBT

7.1. Custom Fields

7.1.1. Overview

   Different teams typically like to capture different information
   as users report issues, in some cases, the data required is
   even different from one project to another. Hence, MantisBT
   provides the ability for managers and administrators to define
   custom fields as way to extend MantisBT to deal with
   information that is specific to their teams or their projects.
   The aim is for this to keep MantisBT native fields to a
   minimum. Following are some facts about the implementation of
   custom fields in MantisBT:

     * Custom fields are defined system wide.
     * Custom fields can be linked to multiple projects.
     * The sequence of displaying custom fields can be different
       per project.
     * Custom fields must be defined by users with access level
       ADMINISTRATOR.
     * Custom fields can be linked to projects by users with
       access level MANAGER or above (by default, this can be
       configurable).
     * Number of custom fields is not restricted.
     * Users can define filters that include custom fields.
     * Custom fields can be included in View Issues, Print Issues,
       and CSV exports.
     * Enumeration custom fields can have a set of static values
       or values that are calculated dynamically based on a custom
       function.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.2. Custom Field Definition

   The definition of a custom field includes the following logical
   attributes:

     * Caption variable name (eg: This is the value that is
       supplied to lang_get() API, or displayed as-is if not found
       in language file). This should not include any space or any
       character that would be an invalid PHP identifier.
     * Custom field type (string, numeric, float, enumeration,
       email, checkbox, radio, list, multi-selection list, date).
       Type 'string' is used for strings of up to 255 characters.
       Type 'numeric' is used for numerical integer values.
       Type 'float' is used for real (float / double) numbers.
       Type 'enumeration' is used when a user selects one entry
       from a list. The user interface for such type is a
       combo-box.
       Type 'email' is used for storing email addresses.
       Type 'checkbox' is like enumeration but the list is shown
       as checkboxes and the user is allowed to tick more than one
       selection. The default value and the possible value can
       contain multiple values like 'RED|YELLOW|BLUE' (without the
       single quote).
       Type 'radio' is like enumeration but the list is shown as
       radio buttons and th euser is allowed to tick on of the
       options. The possible values can be 'RED|YELLOW|BLUE',
       where the default value can be 'YELLOW'. Note that the
       default value can't contain multiple values.
       Type 'list' is like enumeration but the list is shown as a
       list box where the user is only allowed to select one
       option. The possible values can be 'RED|YELLOW|BLUE', where
       the default value can be 'YELLOW'. Note that the default
       value can't contain multiple values.
       Type 'multi-selection list' is like enumeration but the
       list is shown as a list box where the user is allowed to
       select multiple options. The possible values can be
       'RED|YELLOW|BLUE', where the default value can be
       'RED|BLUE'. Note that in this case the default value
       contains multiple values.
       Type 'date' is for date values. The default value can be
       empty, or {tomorrow}, {yesterday}, {next week}, {last
       week}, {+3 days}, {-2 days}.
     * Enumeration possible values (eg: RED|YELLOW|BLUE). Use the
       pipe ('|') character to separate possible values for an
       enumeration. One of the possible values can be an empty
       string. The set of possible values can also be calculated
       at runtime. For example, "=versions" would automatically
       resolve into all the versions defined for the current
       project.
     * Default value - see details above for a sample default
       value for each type.
     * Minimum/maximum length for the custom field value (use 0 to
       disable). Note that these metrics are not really relevant
       to custom fields that are based on an enumeration of
       possible values.
     * Regular expression to use for validating user input (use
       PCRE syntax).
     * Read Access level: Minimum access level for users to be
       able to see the value of the custom field.
     * Write Access level: Minimum access level for users to be
       able to edit the value of the custom field.
     * Display when reporting issues? - If this custom field
       should be shown on the Report Issue page.
     * Display when updating issues? - If this custom field should
       be shown on the Update Issue page.
     * Display when resolving issues? - If this custom field
       should be shown when resolving an issue. For example, a
       "root cause" custom field would make sense to set when
       resolving the issue.
     * Display when closing issues? - If this custom field should
       be shown when closing an issue.
     * Required on Report - If this custom field is a mandatory
       field on the Report Issue page.
     * Required on Update - If this custom field is a mandatory
       field on the Update Issue page.
     * Required on Resolve - If this custom field is a mandatory
       field when resolving an issue.
     * Required on Close - If this custom field is a mandatory
       field when closing an issue.

   All custom fields are currently saved to a field of type
   VARCHAR(255) in the database. However, in future releases, it
   is possible to support custom fields of different types (eg:
   memo, file).

   If the value of a custom field for a certain defect is not
   found, the default value is assumed.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.3. Adding/Editing Custom Fields

     * The logged in user needs $g_manage_custom_fields_threshold
       access level.
     * Select "Manage" from the main menu.
     * Select "Manage Custom Fields" from the management menu.
     * In case of edit, click on the name of an existing custom
       field to edit its information.
     * In case of adding a new one, enter the name of the new
       custom field then click "New Custom Field".

   Note

        Added custom fields will not show up in any of the issues until
        the added custom field is linked to the appropriate projects.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.4. Linking/Unlinking/Ordering Existing Custom Fields in Projects

     * The logged in user needs to have access level that is
       greater than or equal to $g_custom_field_link_threshold and
       $g_manage_project_threshold.
     * Select "Manage" from the main menu.
     * Select "Manage Projects".
     * Select the name of the project to manage.
     * Scroll down to the "Custom Fields" box.
     * Select the field to add from the list, then click "Add This
       Existing Custom Field".
     * To change the order of the custom fields, edit the
       "Sequence" value and click update. Custom fields with
       smaller values are displayed first.
     * To unlink a custom field, click on "Remove" link next to
       the field. Unlinking a custom field will not delete the
       values that are associated with the issues for this field.
       These values are only deleted if the custom field
       definition is removed (not unlinked!) from the database.
       This is useful if you decide to re-link the custom field.
       These values may also re-appear if issues are moved to
       another project which has this field linked.

   Moving Issues. When an issue is moved from one project to
   another, custom fields that are not defined for the new project
   are not deleted. These fields will re-appear with their correct
   values if the issue is moved back to the original project, or
   if these custom fields are linked to the new project.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.5. Localizing Custom Field Names

   It is possible to localize the label for the custom fields.
   This can be as follows:

     * Give the custom field a valid variable name (i.e. start
       with an alpha character, no spaces, etc) - For example, we
       will use "my_start_date" for a custom field of type "Date"
       which stores the "Start Date" for working on an issue.
     * Add the localized string for "my_start_date" - This can be
       done by creating custom_strings_inc.php in the MantisBT
       root folder and adding the following code to it:
<?php
if ( lang_get_current() == 'german' ) {
    $s_my_start_date = 'Start Date XX';  // German translation of Start
Date
} else {
    # Default (use your preferred language as the default)
    $s_my_start_date = 'Start Date';
}
?>

   Note

        If we would have decided to use start_date as the name of the
        custom field, then we have used an already localized string
        from MantisBT standard strings. In this case, there is no need
        to create the custom_strings_inc.php or to add any strings to
        it. To check for standard strings, inspect
        lang/strings_english.txt.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.6. Dynamic default values

7.1.6.1. Dynamic defaults for Date fields

   Custom fields of type date can be defaulted to a specific dates
   or to relative dates. Typically relative dates is the scenario
   that makes sense in most of the cases. The format for specific
   dates is an integer which indicates the number of seconds since
   the Unix Epoch (January 1 1970 00:00:00 GMT), which is the
   format consumed by the PHP date() method. The relative scenario
   expects default values like {tomorrow}, {yesterday}, {+2 days},
   {-3 days}, {next week}, etc. The curly brackets indicate that
   this is a logical value which is then evaluated using the PHP
   strtotime() function.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.7. Dynamic values for Enumeration Custom Fields

   As discussed earlier, one of the possible types of a custom
   field is "enumeration". This type of custom field allows the
   user to select one value from a provided list of possible
   values. The standard way of defining such custom fields is to
   provide a '|' separated list of possible values. However, this
   approach has two limitations: the list is static, and the
   maximum length of the list must be no longer than 255
   characters. Hence, the need for the ability to construct the
   list of possible values dynamically.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.7.1. Dynamic possible values included by default

   MantisBT ships with some dynamic possible values, these include
   the following:

     * =categories - a list of categories defined in the current
       project (or the project to which the issue belongs).
     * =versions - a list of all versions defined in the current
       project (or the project to which the issue belongs).
     * =future_versions - a list of all versions that belong to
       the current project with released flag set to false.
     * =released_versions - a list of all versions that belong to
       the current project with released flag set to true.

   Note

        The '=' before the name of the dynamic list of options is used
        to tell MantisBT that this is a dynamic list, rather than a
        static list with just one option.
     __________________________________________________________

7.1.7.2. Defining Custom Dynamic Possible Values

   If the user selects =versions, the actual custom function that
   is executed is custom_function_*_enum_versions(). The reason
   why the "enum_" is not included is to have a fixed prefix for
   all custom functions used for this purpose and protect against
   users using custom functions that were not intended for this
   purpose. For example, you don't want the user to use
   custom_function_*_issue_delete_notify() which may be overridden
   by the web master to delete associated data in other databases.

   Following is a sample custom function that is used to populate
   a field with the categories belonging to the currently selected
   project:
# --------------------
# Construct an enumeration for all categories for the current project.
# The enumeration will be empty if current project is ALL PROJECTS.
# Enumerations format is: "abc|lmn|xyz"
# To use this in a custom field type "=categories" in the possible value
s field.
function custom_function_override_enum_categories() {
    $t_categories = category_get_all_rows( helper_get_current_project()
);

    $t_enum = array();
    foreach( $t_categories as $t_category ) {
        $t_enum[] = $t_category['category'];
    }

    $t_possible_values = implode( '|', $t_enum );

    return $t_possible_values;
}

   Notice the following:

     * The custom function doesn't take any parameters.
     * The custom function returns the possible values in the
       format (A|B|C).
     * The custom function uses the current project.
     * The custom function builds on top of the already existing
       APIs.

   To define your own function \u201c=mine\u201d, you will have to
   define it with the following signature:
# --------------------
# To use this in a custom field type "=mine" in the possible values fiel
d.
function custom_function_override_enum_mine() {
    $t_enum = array();

    :

    $t_possible_values = implode( '|', $t_enum );

    return $t_possible_values;
}

   Notice "override" in the function name. This is because this
   method is defined by the MantisBT adminstrator/webmaster and
   not part of the MantisBT source. It is OK to override a method
   that doesn't exist.

   As usual, when MantisBT is upgraded to future releases, the
   custom functions will not be overwritten. The difference
   between the "default" implementation and the "override"
   implementation is explained in more details in the custom
   functions section.
     __________________________________________________________

7.2. Enumerations

   Enumerations are used in MantisBT to represent a set of
   possible values for an attribute. Enumerations are used for
   access levels, severities, priorities, project statuses,
   project view state, reproducibility, resolution, ETA, and
   projection. MantisBT provides the administrator with the
   flexibility of altering the values in these enumerations. The
   rest of this topic explains how enumerations work, and then how
   they can be customised.

   How enumerations work? core/constant_inc.php defines the
   constants that correspond to those in the enumeration. These
   are useful to refer to these enumerations in the configs and
   the code.
                    define( 'VIEWER', 10 )
                    define( 'REPORTER', 25 )
                    define( 'UPDATER',  40 )
                    define( 'DEVELOPER', 55 )
                    define( 'MANAGER', 70 )
                    define( 'ADMINISTRATOR', 90 )

   config_defaults_inc.php includes the defaults for the
   enumerations. The configuration options that are defaulted here
   are used in specifying which enumerations are active and should
   be used in MantisBT. However, the strings included in the
   enumerations here are just for documentation purpose, they are
   not shown to the user (due to the need for localisation).
   Hence, if an entry in this enumeration is not found in the
   corresponding localised enumeration (i.e. 70:manager), then it
   will be printed to the user as @70@.
                $g_access_levels_enum_string =
                '10:viewer,25:reporter,40:updater,55:developer,70:manage
r,90:administrator';

   lang/strings_german.txt provide the localised strings (in this
   case, in german) for enumerations. But again, the master list
   is the enumeration in the configs, the ones in the language
   files are just used for finding the localised equivalent for an
   entry. Hence, if a user changes the config to have only two
   types of users developers and administrators, then only those
   will be prompted to the users even if the enumerations in the
   language files still includes the full list.
                $s_access_levels_enum_string =
                '10:Betrachter,25:Reporter,40:Updater,55:Entwickler,70:M
anager,90:Administrator';

   How can they be customised? Let say we want to remove access
   level "Updater" and add access level "Senior Developer".

   The file custom_constants_inc.php is supported for the
   exclusive purpose of allowing administrators to define their
   own constants while maintaining a simple upgrade path for
   future releases of MantisBT. Note that this file is not
   distributed with MantisBT and you will need to create it if you
   need such customisation. In our example, we need to define a
   constant for the new access level.
                define ( 'SENIOR_DEVELOPER', 60 );

   In config_inc.php
                // Remove Updater and add Senior Developer
                $g_access_levels_enum_string =
                '10:viewer,25:reporter,55:developer,60:senior_developer,
70:manager,90:administrator';
                // Give access to Senior developers to create/delete cus
tom field.
                $g_manage_custom_fields_threshold = SENIOR_DEVELOPER;

   The file custom_strings_inc.php is introduced for a similar
   reason to that of custom_constants_inc.php, which is to define
   custom strings. The advantage of defining them here is to
   provide a simple upgrade path, and avoid having to re-do the
   changes when upgrading to the next MantisBT release. Note that
   you will need to create this file if you need such
   customisation. The file is automatically detected and included
   by MantisBT code.
                # Note that we don't have to remove the Updater entry fr
om the
                localisation file if ( lang_get_current() === 'english'
) {
                $s_access_levels_enum_string =
                '10:Betrachter,25:Reporter,40:Updater,55:Entwickler,60:S
enior
                Developer,70:Manager,90:Administrator'; }

   Conclusion. We have covered how enumerations work in general,
   and how to customise one of them. If you are interested in
   customising other enumerations, a good starting point would be
   to go to "MantisBT Enum Strings" section in
   config_defaults_inc.php. This section defines all enumerations
   that are used by MantisBT. For versions that are older than
   0.18.0, custom_*_inc.php files are not supported, and hence you
   will need to change in the actual constants / language files
   directly.

7.3. Email Notifications

   See Email in the Configuration section.

   Examples:

     * Notify only managers of new issues.
                            $g_notify_flags['new']['threshold_min'] = MA
NAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['new']['threshold_max'] = MA
NAGER;

     * Notify Developers and managers of all project events,
       except, exclude developers from the 'closed' events.
$g_default_notify_flags['threshold_min'] = DEVELOPER;
                            $g_default_notify_flags['threshold_max'] = M
ANAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['closed']['threshold_max'] =
 MANAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['closed']['threshold_max'] =
 MANAGER;

     * Exclude those who contributed issue notes from getting
       messages about other changes in the issue.
$g_default_notify_flags['bugnotes'] = OFF;
     * Exclude those monitoring issues from seeing the 'closed'
       message
$g_notify_flags['closed']['monitor'] = OFF;
     * Only notify developers when issue notes are added.
$g_notify_flags['bugnote']['threshold_min'] = DEVELOPER;
                            $g_notify_flags['bugnote']['threshold_max']
= DEVELOPER;

     * Notify managers of changes in sponsorship.
$g_notify_flags['sponsor']['threshold_max'] = MANAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['sponsor']['threshold_max']
= MANAGER;

     * Notify originator and managers of changes in ownership
       ("Assigned To:").
$g_notify_flags['owner']['threshold_max'] = MANAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['owner']['threshold_max'] =
MANAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['owner']['reporter'] = ON;

     * I'm paranoid about mail. Only send information on issues to
       those involved in them. Don't send mail people already know
       about. Also send new issue notifications to managers so
       they can screen them.
$g_mail_receive_own = OFF;
                            $g_default_notify_flags =
                            array('reporter' => ON, 'handler' => ON, 'mo
nitor' => ON,
                            'bugnotes' => ON, 'threshold_min' => NOBODY,
 'threshold_max'
                            => NOBODY);
                            $g_notify_flags['new']['threshold_min'] = MA
NAGER;
                            $g_notify_flags['new']['threshold_max'] = MA
NAGER;

     * How do I replace the $g_to_email configuration variable to
       log all messages to an email logger.
       You will need to create a dummy user with the appropriate
       access level for the notices you want to log. Once this
       user is added to projects, they will receive mail using the
       appropriate rules.
     __________________________________________________________

7.4. Customizing Status Values

   The default is no workflow, where all states are accessible
   from any others. The following example can be transferred to
   config_inc.php. The workflow needs to have a path from the
   statuses greater than or equal to the resolved state back to
   the feedback state. Otherwise, the re-open operation won't
   work.
$g_status_enum_workflow[NEW_]=
                '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,50:assi
gned,80:resolved';
                $g_status_enum_workflow[FEEDBACK] =
                '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,50:assi
gned,80:resolved';
                $g_status_enum_workflow[ACKNOWLEDGED] =
                '20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,50:assigned,80
:resolved';
                $g_status_enum_workflow[CONFIRMED] =
                '20:feedback,40:confirmed,50:assigned,80:resolved';
                $g_status_enum_workflow[ASSIGNED] =
                '20:feedback,50:assigned,80:resolved,90:closed';
                $g_status_enum_workflow[RESOLVED] =
                '50:assigned,80:resolved,90:closed';
                $g_status_enum_workflow[CLOSED] = '50:assigned';

   To add a status:

    1. Define a constant to map the new status to.In a new file
       custom_constants_inc.php in the main mantisbt directory:
<?php define ( 'TEST', 60 ); ?>
    2. Define the language strings required. This may need to be
       defined in several languages.In a new file
       custom_strings_inc.php in the main mantisbt directory:
<?php if ( lang_get_current() == 'german' ) {
                            $s_status_enum_string =
                            '10:neu,20:R¸ckmeldung,30:anerkannt,40:best
‰tigt,50:zugewiesen,
                            60:zu testen,80:behoben,90:geschlossen'; } e
lse {
                            $s_status_enum_string =
                            '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confi
rmed,50:assigned, 60:to
                            be tested,80:resolved,90:closed'; $s_to_be_t
ested_bug_button =
                            "Issue Ready to Test"; $s_to_be_tested_bug_t
itle = "Set Issue Ready
                            to Test"; $s_email_notification_title_for_st
atus_bug_to_be_tested =
                            "The following issue is ready TO BE TESTED."
; } ?>

    3. Define any configurations required.In the existing file
       config_inc.php in the main mantisbt directory:
$g_status_enum_string =
                            '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confi
rmed,50:assigned, 60:to
                            be tested,80:resolved,90:closed'; # Status c
olor additions
                            $g_status_colors['to be tested'] = '#ACE7AE'
;

    4. Add the status to any workflow defined.In config_inc.php:
$g_status_enum_workflow[NEW_]=
                            '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confi
rmed,50:assigned,60:to
                            be tested'; $g_status_enum_workflow[FEEDBACK
] =
                            '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confi
rmed,50:assigned,60:to
                            be tested'; $g_status_enum_workflow[ACKNOWLE
DGED] =
                            '20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confi rmed,5
0:assigned,60:to be
                            tested'; $g_status_enum_workflow[CONFIRMED]
=
                            '20:feedback,40:confirmed,50:assigned,60:to
be tested';
                            $g_status_enum_workflow[ASSIGNED] = '20:feed
back,50:assigned,60:to
                            be tested,90:closed'; $g_status_enum_workflo
w[TEST] =
                            '10:new,20:feedback,50:assigned,60:to be
                            tested,80:resolved,90:closed'; $g_status_enu
m_workflow[RESOLVED] =
                            '50:assigned,60:to be tested,80:resolved,90:

                            $g_status_enum_workflow[CLOSED] = '50:assign

     __________________________________________________________

7.5. Custom Functions

   Custom functions are used to extend the functionality of
   MantisBT by integrating user writtenfunctions into the issue
   processing at strategic places. This allows the system
   administrator to changethe functionality without re-writing
   parts of the internals of the code.

   User versions of these functions are placed in a file called
   custom_functions_inc.php in the root directory of MantisBT.
   This is the same place that the "config_inc.php" file modifying
   MantisBT defaults is placed. In normal processing, MantisBT
   will look for override functions and execute them instead of
   the provided default functions.

   Custom functions have names like
   custom_function_override_descriptive_name where descriptive
   namedescribed the particular function. The specific functions
   are described below. The simplest way tocreate a custom
   function is to copy the default function, named
   custom_function_default_descriptive_namefrom the
   core/custom_function_api.php file to your override file
   (custom_functions_inc.php), andrename it. The specific
   functionality you need can then be coded into the override
   function.
     __________________________________________________________

7.5.1. Defined Functions

   custom_function_default_changelog_include_issue( $p_issue_id )
   returns true or false if the issue if to be included in the
   Changelogcustom_function_default_changelog_print_issue(
   $p_issue_id ) returns a formatted string to be included for the
   issue in the Changelogcustom_function_default_checkin(
   $p_issue_id, $p_comment, $p_file, $p_new_version ) registers a
   checkin in source control in MantisBT
   custom_function_default_issue_update_validate( $p_issue_id,
   $p_new_bug, $p_bug_note_text ) validate issue field settings
   before an update occurs. It returns true or fails with an
   error.custom_function_default_issue_update_notify( $p_issue_id
   ) notify after an issue has been
   updatedcustom_function_default_issue_create_validate(
   $p_new_bug ) validate issue field settings before an issue is
   created. It returns true or fails with an
   error.custom_function_default_issue_create_notify( $p_issue_id
   ) notify after an issue has been
   openedcustom_function_default_issue_delete_validate(
   $p_issue_id ) validate issue field settings before an issue can
   be deleted. It returns true or fails with an
   error.custom_function_default_issue_delete_notify( $p_issue_id
   ) notify after an issue has been deleted
     __________________________________________________________

7.5.2. Example Custom Function

   The following function is used to validate an issue before it
   is resolved.
<?php
# --------------------
# Hook to validate Validate field settings before resolving
# verify that the resolution is not set to OPEN
# verify that the fixed in version is set (if versions of the product ex
ist)

function custom_function_override_issue_update_validate( $p_issue_id, $p
_bug_data, $p_bugnote_text ) {
if ( $p_bug_data->status == RESOLVED ) {
if ( $p_bug_data->resolution == OPEN ) {
error_parameters( 'the resolution cannot be open to resolve the issue' )
;
trigger_error( ERROR_BUG_VALIDATE_FAILURE, ERROR );
}
$t_version_count = count( version_get_all_rows( $p_bug_data-&gt;project_
id ) );
if ( ( $t_version_count > 0 ) && ( $p_bug_data->fixed_in_version == '' )
 ) {
error_parameters( 'fixed in version must be set to resolve the issue' );
trigger_error( ERROR_BUG_VALIDATE_FAILURE, ERROR );
}
}
}
?>

   The errors will also need to be defined by adding the following
   to custom_constants_inc.php
                        define ( 'ERROR_VALIDATE_FAILURE', 2000 );
                        To custom_strings_inc.php
                        $MANTIS_ERROR['ERROR_VALIDATE_FAILURE'] = 'This
change cannot be made because %s';
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 8. Authentication

   MantisBT supports several authentication methods out of the
   box. In addition, there is work in progress relating to
   supporting authentication plug-ins. Once these are implemented,
   authentication against any protocol or repository of user names
   and passwords will be possible without having to touch MantisBT
   core code.

   It is important to note that MantisBT does not yet support
   hybrid authentication scenarios. For example, internal staff
   authenticating against LDAP while customers authenticate
   against the MantisBT database with MD5 hash.

   See $g_login_method in Global authentication parameters for
   more details about how to configure MantisBT to use one of
   these authentication techniques.
     __________________________________________________________

8.1. Standard Authentication

   With Standard login method, MantisBT users are authenticated
   against records in the MantisBT database, where the passwords
   are stored as a hash.

   Note: while technically unlimited, the password's length is
   arbitrarily restricted to 1024 characters
   (PASSWORD_MAX_SIZE_BEFORE_HASH constant).

   Values for $g_login_method:

     * MD5 is the default - and recommended - method
     * Support for additional methods (e.g. SHA-1) could be added
       in the future
     __________________________________________________________

8.2. LDAP and Microsoft Active Directory

   Value for $g_login_method: LDAP

   Authentication is made against an LDAP or Active Directory
   server.

   The LDAP parameters should be setup as explained in LDAP
   authentication parameters.

   An MD5 hash of the user's password will be stored in the
   database upon successful login, allowing fall-back to Standard
   Authentication when the LDAP server is not available.

   The user's ID and password is checked against the Directory; if
   the credentials are valid, then the user is allowed to login
   and their user account in MantisBT is created automatically.
     __________________________________________________________

8.3. Basic Authentication

   Value for $g_login_method: BASIC_AUTH

   When MantisBT is configured to use basic auth, it automatically
   detects the logged in user and checks if they are already
   registered in MantisBT, if not, then a new account is
   automatically created for the username.

   The password length is limited to the size of the underlying
   database field (DB_FIELD_SIZE_PASSWORD constant), currently 32
   characters.
     __________________________________________________________

8.4. HTTP Authentication

   Value for $g_login_method: HTTP_AUTH

   TODO

   The password length is limited to the size of the underlying
   database field (DB_FIELD_SIZE_PASSWORD constant), currently 32
   characters.
     __________________________________________________________

8.5. Deprecated authentication methods

   The following methods of authentication are deprecated, and
   supported for backwards-compatibility reasons only. It is
   strongly recommended to update MantisBT installations relying
   on these to use standard authentication instead.

   Deprecated values for $g_login_method:

     * CRYPT
     * CRYPT_FULL_SALT
     * PLAIN

   With CRYPT-based methods, the password's length is limited as
   per Standard Authentication. With PLAIN, its size is restricted
   as for Basic Authentication.
     __________________________________________________________

Chapter 9. Project Management

   This section covers the project management features of
   MantisBT. This includes features like change log, roadmap, time
   tracking, reporting and others.
     __________________________________________________________

9.1. Change Log

   MantisBT doesn't just track the status of issues, it also
   relates issues to versions. Each project can have several
   versions, which are marked with attributes like released and
   obsolete. Users typically report issues against released issues
   and developers typically fix issues in not released versions.
   With every new release comes question like: what's new? what
   has been fixed? Customers wonder if the new release is of
   interest to them and whether they should take an upgrade. Well,
   the change log is specifically tailored to answer these kind of
   questions.

   In order for an issue to show up in the change log, it has to
   satisfy certain criteria. The criteria is that the issue has to
   be resolved with a 'fixed' resolution and has to have the
   'fixed_in_version' field set. Users sometimes wonder why
   resolved or closed issues don't show up in the change log, and
   the answer is that the 'fixed_in_version' field is not set.
   Without the 'fixed_in_version', it is not possible for MantisBT
   to include the issues in the appropriate section of the
   changelog. Note that it is possible to set the
   'fixed_in_version' for multiple issues using the 'Update Fixed
   in Version' group action on the View Issues page (just below
   the issues list). This option is only available when the
   selected project is not 'All Projects'. Once a version is
   marked as obsolete, it is now longer included in the change
   log.

   MantisBT also provides the ability to customize the criteria
   used for an issue to be included in the change log. For
   example, for installations that use a custom set of
   resolutions, it is possible to select multiple resolutions as
   valid candidates for the change log. This can be done using
   custom functions (see custom functions documentation for more
   details). The custom function below overrides the MantisBT
   default behavior to include issues with both FIXED and
   IMPLEMENTED (a custom resolution) resolutions in the change
   log.
# --------------------
# Checks the provided bug and determines whether it should be included i
n the changelog
# or not.
# returns true: to include, false: to exclude.
function custom_function_override_changelog_include_issue( $p_issue_id )
 {
    $t_issue = bug_get( $p_issue_id );

    return ( ( $t_issue->resolution == FIXED || $t_issue->resolution ==
IMPLEMENTED ) &&
        ( $t_issue->status >= config_get( 'bug_resolved_status_threshold
' ) ) );
}

   MantisBT also provides the ability to customize the details to
   include from the issue and in what format. This can be done
   using the following custom function.
# --------------------
# Prints one entry in the changelog.
function custom_function_override_changelog_print_issue( $p_issue_id, $p
_issue_level = 0 ) {
    $t_bug = bug_get( $p_issue_id );

    if ( $t_bug->category_id ) {
        $t_category_name = category_get_name( $t_bug->category_id );
    } else {
        $t_category_name = '';
    }

    $t_category = is_blank( $t_category_name ) ? '' : '<b>[' . $t_catego
ry_name . ']</b> ';
    echo str_pad( '', $p_issue_level * 6, ' ' ), '- ', string_get_bug_vi
ew_link( $p_issue_id ), ': ', $t_category, string_display_line_links( $t
_bug->summary );

    if ( $t_bug->handler_id != 0 ) {
        echo ' (', prepare_user_name( $t_bug->handler_id ), ')';
    }

    echo ' - ', get_enum_element( 'status', $t_bug->status ), '.<br />';
}

   By combining both customization features, it is also possible
   to do more advanced customization scenarios. For example, users
   can add a 'ChangelogSummary' custom field and include all
   issues that have such field in the change log. Through
   customizing what information being included for a qualifying
   issue, users can also include the 'ChangelogSummary' text
   rather than the native summary field.

   In some cases, users know that they fixed an issue and that the
   fix will be included in the next release, however, they don't
   know yet the name of the release. In such case, the recommended
   approach is to always have a version defined that corresponds
   to the next release, which is typicalled called 'Next Release'.
   Once the release is cut and has a concrete name, then 'Next
   Release' can be renamed to the appropriate name and a new 'Next
   Release' can then be created. For teams that manage releases
   from multiple branches for the same project, then more than one
   next release can be possible. For example, 'Next Dev Release'
   and 'Next Stable Release'.

   Another common requirement is to be able to link to the change
   log of a specific project from the project's main website.
   There is a variety of ways to do that:

     * To link to the changelog of version "ver1" of project
       "myproject":
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/changelog_page.php?project=myproject&version=ver1

     * To link to the changelog of all non-obsolete versions of
       project 'myproject':
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/changelog_page.php?project=myproject

     * To link to the changelog of project with id 1. The project
       id can be figured out by going to the management page for
       the project and getting the value of project_id field form
       the URL.
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/changelog_page.php?project_id=1

     * To link to the changelog of version with id 1. The version
       id is unique accross all projects and hence in this case it
       is not necessary to include the project id/name. The
       version id can be figured out by going to the manage
       project page and editing the required version. The
       version_id will be included in the URL.
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/changelog_page.php?version_id=1

   Another approach is to go to the project page and from there
   users can get to multiple other locations relating to the
   project include the change log. This can be done by a URL like
   the following:
http://www.example.com/mantisbt/project_page.php?project_id=1

   It is possible to customize the access level required for
   viewing the change log page. This can be done using the
   $g_view_changelog_threshold configuration option.

9.2. Roadmap

   One of the very important scenarios in project management is
   where the project managers (or team leads) triage the issues to
   set their priorities, target version, and possibly assign the
   issues to specific developers or take other actions on the
   issue. By setting the target version of an issue to a version
   that is not yet released, the issue shows up on the project
   roadmap, providing user with information about when to expect
   the issues to be resolved. The roadmap page has a section for
   each release showing information like planned issues, issues
   done and percentage of issues completed. Issues that are fixed
   in a specific version, but didn't have the target_version field
   set, will not show up in the roadmap. This allows the ability
   to control the issues that are significant enough to show in
   the roadmap, while all resolved fields can be found in the
   change log. Note that it is possible to set the
   'target_version' for multiple issues using the 'Update Target
   Version' group action that is available through the View Issues
   page (below the issues list). This option is only available
   when the current project is not 'All Projects'. Although it is
   not a typical scenario, it is worth mentioning that once a
   version is marked as obsolete, it is not included in the
   roadmap.

   Note that the roadmap only includes future versions, once a
   version is marked as released, it no longer is included in the
   roadmap. For information about such releases, the change log
   feature should be used. For an issue to be shown on the
   roadmap, it has to have the target version set. It does not
   matter whether the feature is resolved or not. Resolved
   features will be decorated with a strikethrough and will be
   counted as done.

   MantisBT provides the ability to customize the criteria for
   issues to show up on the roadmap. The default criteria is that
   the issue has to belong to a version that is not yet released
   and that the issues is not a duplicate. However, such criteria
   can be customized by using custom functions as below.
# --------------------
# Checks the provided bug and determines whether it should be included i
n the roadmap or not.
# returns true: to include, false: to exclude.
function custom_function_override_roadmap_include_issue( $p_issue_id ) {
    return ( true );
}

   It is also possible to customize the details included about an
   issues and the presentation of such details. This can be done
   through the following custom function:
# --------------------
# Prints one entry in the roadmap.
function custom_function_override_roadmap_print_issue( $p_issue_id, $p_i
ssue_level = 0 ) {
    $t_bug = bug_get( $p_issue_id );

    if ( bug_is_resolved( $p_issue_id ) ) {
        $t_strike_start = '<strike>';
        $t_strike_end = '</strike>';
    } else {
        $t_strike_start = $t_strike_end = '';
    }

    if ( $t_bug->category_id ) {
        $t_category_name = category_get_name( $t_bug->category_id );
    } else {
        $t_category_name = '';
    }

    $t_category = is_blank( $t_category_name ) ? '' : '<b>[' . $t_catego
ry_name . ']</b> ';

    echo str_pad( '', $p_issue_level * 6, ' ' ), '- ', $t_strike_start,
string_get_bug_view_link( $p_issue_id ), ': ', $t_category, string_displ
ay_line_links( $t_bug->summary );

    if ( $t_bug->handler_id != 0 ) {
        echo ' (', prepare_user_name( $t_bug->handler_id ), ')';
    }

    echo ' - ', get_enum_element( 'status', $t_bug->status ), $t_strike_
end, '.<br />';
}

   Some teams manage different branches for each of their projects
   (e.g. development and maintenance branches). As part of
   triaging the issue, they may decide that an issue should be
   targetted to multiple branches. Hence, frequently the request
   comes up to be able to target a single issue to multiple
   releases. The current MantisBT approach is that an issues
   represents an implementation or a fix for an issue on a
   specific branch. Since sometimes applying and verifying a fix
   to the two branches does not happen at the same time and in
   some cases the approach for fixing an issue is different based
   on the branch. Hence, the way to manage such scenario is to
   have the main issue for the initial fix and have related issues
   which capture the work relating to applying the fix to other
   branches. The issues for porting the fix can contain any
   discussions relating to progress, reflect the appropriate
   status and can go through the standard workflow process
   independent of the original issues.

   Another common requirement is to be able to link to the roadmap
   of a specific project from the project's main website. There is
   a variety of ways to do that:

     * To link to the roadmap of version "ver1" of project
       "myproject":
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/roadmap_page.php?project=myproject&version=ver1

     * To link to the roadmap of all non-obsolete versions of
       project 'myproject':
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/roadmap_page.php?project=myproject

     * To link to the roadmap of project with id 1. The project id
       can be figured out by going to the management page for the
       project and getting the value of project_id field form the
       URL.
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/roadmap_page.php?project_id=1

     * To link to the roadmap of version with id 1. The version id
       is unique accross all projects and hence in this case it is
       not necessary to include the project id/name. The version
       id can be figured out by going to the manage project page
       and editing the required version. The version_id will be
       included in the URL.
                                                http://www.example.com/m
antisbt/roadmap_page.php?version_id=1

   Another approach is to go to the project page and from there
   users can get to multiple other locations relating to the
   project include the roadmap. This can be done by a URL like the
   following:
http://www.example.com/mantisbt/project_page.php?project_id=1

   The access level required to view and modify the roadmap can be
   configured through $g_roadmap_view_threshold and
   $g_roadmap_update_threshold respectively. Modifying the roadmap
   is the ability to set the target versions for issues. Users who
   have such access can set the target versions while reporting
   new issues or by updating existing issues.

9.3. Time Tracking

   This is currently a work in progress. To follow the work have a
   look on the wiki page Time Tracking (Issue 4428)

   To activate the Time Tracking feature you have to set the
   configuration option "time_tracking_enabled" to ON. To
   activating the Time Tracking you can :

     * Static solution : change the variable
       '$g_time_tracking_enabled' in the configuration file
       'config_defaults_inc.php', this will change the
       configuration for all the MantisBT instance ;
     * Dynamic and "project by project" solution : Use the
       administration page "Manage Configuration" and set the
       variable 'time_tracking_enabled' to '1' for which user and
       which project of you choice.

   All Time Tracking configuration options are described in the
   configuration section off this guide.
