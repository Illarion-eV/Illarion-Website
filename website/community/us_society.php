   <h2>Support Membership</h2>
   <p>Illarion is a game which is provided to you for no money. Nevertheless we (as a registered society) have to pay anyway for server, traffic, domains and so on.</p>

   <p>The simplest way to cover our expenses in a predictable way is your Illarion society support membership for only 10 Euro per year. Because both sides should have a benefit, we thought about advantages for those members.</p>

   <p>As fundamental idea we don't want to offer any in-game advantages, because this would be just a premium game account for people who are able to pay.</p>

   <p>The following benefits are available for support members on <a href="http://illarion.org/community/de_contact.php?contact=25">request</a> right now:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>An own forwarding email address to your specified account email address (e.g. charactername@illarion.org)</li>
      <li>Increase of the maximum character number of your account from 5 to 7</li>
      <li>An own guild forum at forum.illarion.org (with group leader and moderator rights)</li>
   </ul>

   <p>This list could be changed at any time (we already have more ideas), but there is no redress in law to get these benefits.</p>

   <p>To become a member, just fill out the form and send it to us:</p>
