   <h2>Ronagan - God of Thieves and Shadows</h2>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Protection from authorities. For all people living in the shadows of life, thieves, assassins,
   prostitutes, etc. Some merchants pray and donate money to him to avoid being robbed.</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Friendly to those roaming in his realm. But has dark moods and can be aggressive. Lives
   according to his own laws. Good humored.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as a dark haired and clothed charming man in his thirties. Sometimes personally appears
   in disguise and helps honorable thieves out of dangerous situations, or renders them invisible
   when they need it most. Likes to appear as a second thief accidentally doing the same
   &quot;run&quot;, giving the other one hints and tips.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes good jokes (plays jokes on those representing the authorities) and a &quot;job&quot; well
   done. Dislikes betrayal and any kind of authority or law abiding system.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Ronagan&#39;s followers are mostly poor people who grow up on the streets, and most become
   thiefs, spies or assassins. They believe that perhaps Ronagan will help them to steal and to
   protect them from the protectors of the rich, the authorities. When they die, they will have to
   break into Ronagan&#39;s Castle, and if they reach the main hall without being caught, they will
   enter paradise. If they are catched, they can try again. If they have much bad luck or no
   talent, Ronagan will give them a quest, mostly to help street children to learn how to become a
   thief.</p>
