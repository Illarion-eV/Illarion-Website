   <h2>Adron - God of Festivities and Wine </h2>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   House God of all taverns and inns. For a good wine season, or simply when the wine bottle is
   dried out.</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Impulsive and sometimes aggressive, much hidden knowledge, doesn&#39;t care for tomorrow, can be
   melancholy.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as green or brown dressed young, attractive man or as ragged old drunken beggar with a
   big clay bottle that never runs out of wine.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Loves celebrations and wine. Likes to speak out his mind no matter what.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Adron&#39;s followers are mostly tavernkeepers or wine growers, praying for a good season and a
   full tavern (and enough wine). Also the younger generations of different races are attracted by
   Adron. His nonchalant way of life, his often youthful appearance and blunt approach to problems
   mirrows best their character, but many of them change their believe reaching adulthood. Some
   bards pray to Adron too. They believe that when they die, there will be a big party - or orgy -
   that lasts forever, and the really bad or evil ones will be condemmned to be servants until they
   are enlightened.</p>
