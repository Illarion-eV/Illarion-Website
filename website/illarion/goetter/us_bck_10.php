   <h1>The Gods of Illarion</h1>

   <?php cap(T); ?>
   
   <p>here are many Gods, many myths, and many legends. The stories told by the Gods to a few
   chosen mortals, may have been changed by the priest&#39;s tongues, to glorify their actions and
   to attract attention. Or sometimes, a prophet has added the one or another part. The Gods
   themselves do not care much about the details - the whole thing must just go in the right
   direction.</p>

   <h2>The Elder Ones</h2>

   <p>Not much is known about their origin, and they seldom let others know something about their
   past. Some people claim to know the answer, but who knows if these stories are true. Most of
   them care little about the fate of Illarion and do not like to be disturbed by mortals. 
   But when they intervene and write history, their majestic radiance leaves no doubt about their power.</p>

   <h2>The Younger Ones</h2>

<p>Ennobled by the Elder Gods to guard and guide the races of Illarion, the Younger Ones are
deeply involved in life itself. In disguise or in person, they started to take sides in the struggle between the powers on
Illarion. Instead of leading the different races and ensuring their peacefull coexistence, they
themself take part in the struggle, fighting for influence and power.</p>
