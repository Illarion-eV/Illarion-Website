<h1>Illarion Game Rules</h1>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>n order to promote a positive game experience for every player, there are 
a few guidelines and rules that we ask players to follow. Doing so will 
provide the best possible roleplay adventure for all.</p>

<p>The most important principle in Illarion though is:</p>

<p><b>We play with, not against each other.</b></p>

<p>We have set a recommended minimum age of 16 years old. Players have to be 
able to handle certain themes and content within the game with maturity.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>Because this is a roleplaying game, your character is not your avatar. 
Let your character have flaws and commit mistakes; we all make mistakes. 
You must separate yourself from your character, and keep in-game matters 
where they belong: in-game. If the behaviour of other players bothers you, 
please contact a gamemaster.</p>

<p>As stated above, we play with, not against each other. Illarion is 
based on cooperative roleplaying, meaning all players work together to 
help shape Illarion. We ask that each player contributes and actively 
participates in a respectful and considerate manner that helps attract 
players from all over the world.</p>

<h2> Common Game Rules </h2>

<p>1. Every player is allowed one account. You are responsible for the 
actions of your characters, regardless if an unauthorized person gained
access to your account.</p>

<p>2. If two players wish to share an internet connection, they must
contact the Illarion staff. </p>

<p>3. Names of characters must fit into a medieval fantasy world and 
also to their race. Well known, historical, mythological, or names 
that are offensive are not permitted, nor are titles (earned in-game).</p>

<p>4. Races that are allowed to play are limited to those that are 
able to be chosen from in the character creation process in your 
account system. Mixed-race characters are not allowed. One must receive 
gamemaster approval for any magical or divine interventions that 
cannot be done be the engine.</p>

<p>5. While the game engine permits and limits some actions, players 
must adapt characters to the “realism” in Illarion, including any 
behaviors that one would exhibit in a medieval fantasy world. Do not
ignore NPC’s or disregard injuries. If struck down or injured, act out
the injuries until health is recovered.</p>

<p>6. It is not permitted for two characters of one player to mix or
interact with each other. One’s characters cannot know each other, nor
can they exchange items with each other or through a middleman. It is 
not allowed to log in with two characters at the same time.</p>

<p>7. Players are not allowed to use out of character (OOC) information 
that they have obtained, but that their character has not. Decisions of
characters should not be influenced by OOC information.</p>

<p>8. Language of characters should match that of a medieval fantasy world.
Leet speak (e.g. u got pwn3d) and modern expressions are not permitted. 
Senseless messages and typing in all capital letters is not permitted.</p>

<p>9. Actions of characters (e.g. fighting, crafting) should be accompanied 
with emotes. Emotes describe perceivable actions and states, not opinions,
thoughts or feelings.</p>

<p>10. Power emotes, or ones that force actions of other characters, are not permitted.</p>

<p>11. Characters must have a valid and traceable reason to attack other characters.
Also, attacking a character after they are resurrected (res-killing) is not allowed.</p>

<p>12. The portrayal of extreme violence and x-rated actions are not permitted 
(e.g. sexual content, glorifying violence, and brutal or perverse acts).</p>

<p>13. All contents that hurt the ideals or moralities of other players are not allowed.</p>

<p>14. Harassment, threats or insults, racist and sexist statements will not be tolerated
in-game, on the forums, or in the chat. It is not acceptable to answer a rule violation 
with one of your own. If you find a rule violation unbearable, please contact the 
Illarion staff.</p>

<p>15. The willful use of game errors (bugs) is forbidden. If a bug is founded, it 
should be reported to the Illarion staff, on the bugtracker.</p>

<p>16. Gamemasters keep the peace in-game and host player events. They also run the 
in-game factions of Cadomyr, Runewick and Galmair. All requests that affect the in-game 
world should be directed to gamemasters.</p>

<p>17. On the forums, the creation of senseless or off-topic posts is not allowed.</p>

<p>18. The usage of additional programs that could influence the behaviour 
of the game are prohibited.</p>

<p>19. The sources of Java software and of the server are released and available 
for public review. All other content is property of Illarion and is therefore 
protected by copyright. It is not allowed to use this content without permission 
of the Illarion society.</p>
