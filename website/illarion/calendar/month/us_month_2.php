	<h2>Month of Flood</h2>

	<p>The second month of spring is named after the creator-goddess Tanora, who is
	supposed to be identical with the water-goddess "Zelphia" of the lizard people.</p>

	<p>A harbor feast is held in many coast towns in Albar and Salkamar. The ice has
	almost completely melted by this time and ships can sail out again.</p>
