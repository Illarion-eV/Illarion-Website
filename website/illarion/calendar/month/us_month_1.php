	<h1>Elos</h1>

	<h2>Month of Magic</h2>

	<p>The first month in spring was named after Elara, goddess of wisdom. Usually the
	end of winter and the beginning of the new year is celebrated on the first Elos.</p>

	<p>There will be great bonfires in each village and town and the houses are
	decorated with lamps and lanterns. These festivities culminate in the burning of a
	scarecrow that is named "Shadowman" or "Darkman". The Illumination Festival serves
	as a banishment of doom and ruin, which has found its way into this realm through
	the month of Mas.</p>

	<p>The origin of this festival has its seeds in the scripts of the Nokorakan Cycle,
	the attempt of a compendium of past century.s prophecies. There one can read the
	following:</p>

	<p style="font-style:italic;">"Flee from the signs of the long night.<br />
	Beg on your knees for your immortal soul,<br />
	when the light denies itself in the crack of dawn.<br />
	For he will rise again from the swamps of agony<br />
	and his shadow will engulf the world in darkness.<br />
	On the wings of death he rides forth<br />
	and where his steps tarry the mortals will fail.<br />
	At this time only the bearers of the fire will curb his arrival.<br />
	And their light will shine like a thousand suns to defy the darkness.<br />
	In the glistering brightness which they ignite, he may burn,<br />
	lest his traces will be extinguished from the earth."</p>
