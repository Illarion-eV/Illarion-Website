		The busy Capricorn
	</h1>

	<h2>Month: Irmas</h2>

<p>Busy Capricorns are masters of trade and are usually successful merchants or craftsmen. Material goods and wealth are close to their hearts and everything has a value. They are talkative and sociable, making them excellent conversationalists in any company. With the banter of some merry Goats, a dark tavern is soon turned into a vivid, thriving establishment. They can be impulsive and impatient, but they are rarely unfair and honour a good barter. Nonetheless they are greedy by nature so don't expect the bargaining to fall in your favour unless their impetuous nature leads them to overreach with a rare bad deal.</p>
