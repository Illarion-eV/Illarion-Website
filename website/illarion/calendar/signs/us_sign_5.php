		The beautiful Butterfly
	</h1>

	<h2>Month: Siros</h2>

<p>The amiable aura of beautiful Butterflies shines from afar. Those born during the month of Siros typically possess a lot of charm and force of attraction, especially to the opposite gender. They love beautiful festivals, enjoy freedom, and live life to its full extent. Awareness of their own attractiveness can on occasion give an impression of smugness but their amiability can usually overcome this. Only seldomly do they reach for the weapon, usually preferring to seek harmony and unison. Even a Butterfly can become angered, however, if you limit their freedom and prevent them from flying freely as they hold a great love for liberty. An emotional, moody Butterfly becomes somewhat less predictable lashing out with rash and unreasoned actions.</p>
