<h1>Races of the world</h1>

<?php cap(A); ?>

<p>n Eagle is escalating higher and higher into the sky above Illarion. In search of prey it
scans the vast lands. It sees the high mountains, seemingly touching the firmament with their
jagged peaks and snowcapped summits. With its sharp eyes it recognizes the hidden entrances to
the great mines of the <a href="us_dwarfs.php" class="eyecatcher">dwarfs</a>, who dug deep into the heart of the mountain ranges to rob the
cold stone of its most precious treasures.</p>

<p>Not far away dense smoke is rising out of the caves of the <a href="us_gnomes.php" class="eyecatcher">gnomes</a>.
The eagle drifts for a moment upon the winds and watches the hustle and bustle of this inventive people, before he turn away.</p>

<p>The howling of the wolf packs is accompanying the eagle who is gliding down the flanks of the
mountains into the wood covered valleys. Here and there a group of bradamen trees rises above
the continuous cover of tree tops and in the thick netting of branches the <a href="us_elfes.php" class="eyecatcher">elven</a> dwellings are
hard to recognize, as their existence seldom leaves marks in the untouched nature.
Sparklings fly up as the eagle lands an a tree for a short rest and the friendly laughters of playing
<a href="us_fairies.php" class="eyecatcher">faeries</a> sounds through the tree tops.</p>

<p>Further on the eagle flies and on its way the mountains are replaced by a gentle rolling
hilly landscape, only intermittent by the great rivers slowly streaming towards the sea. In this
fertile area the villages of the <a href="us_halflings.php" class="eyecatcher">halflings</a> can be found, which dwellings are surrounded by the
well maintained gardens and fields.</p>

<?php cap(E); ?>

<p>re long the eagle reaches the endless wastelands and inhospitable deserts. Few and far
between a column of smoke rises into the sky, testifying the dwellings and campgrounds of the
<a href="us_orcs.php" class="eyecatcher">orcs</a>. Their battle cries echo far across the plains and everyone hearing their shouts is well
advised to enter their realm with great care.
In the near he see also the smaller and more chaotic arranged campgrounds of the <a href="us_goblins.php" class="eyecatcher">goblins</a>.
In spite of the distance it's not hard to recognize the through the camp bustling creatures.</p>

<p>Finally the eagle reaches the windswept coast and comes across the big cities of the proud
<a href="us_humans.php" class="eyecatcher">humans</a>, on which walls and battlements the flags flap in the wind. Between the towers and roofs
it recognizes the buzz of activity filling the market place and the sunbeams are reflected by
the armor of the knights riding on horse backs and trying to find their way through the
crowd.</p>

<p>Starting from the harbor the eagle follows the huge merchant ships setting out on their
perilous trip across the sea. Above the rolling waves it recognizes the dimly outline of the
great praying halls, which were build by the Lizardmen deep below the surface. They live in an
element which is alien to the eagle and while it circles in the sky the <a href="us_lizards.php" class="eyecatcher">lizardmen</a> are gliding
gentle through the sea and only their glistening scales can sometimes be seen through the
water.</p>

<?php cap(T); ?>

<p>he world of Illarion is filled with unexplainable wonders and mysterious places, unutterable
horrors and dangerous locations. Out of the dark past demons and monsters arise longing for the
lives of the mortals. Therefore it is not astonishing that in this magical world in which
everyone&#39;s destiny is fading, the races seek refuge and comfort with the Gods. 16 deities
determine the life in Illarion and exert influence on everything that proofs to be beneficial to
them. In consequence wars have been started and reconciled, whole families seized power and were
overthrown. May it be that there are a few madmen who renounce their existence and defy their
will, but there is no god, who is not aware of the existence of each living being not matter how
insignificant. It would be unwise to ignore such facts.</p>

<p>For the eagle this world is truly alien, nevertheless it continues to circle above Illarion.
But from far up in the sky it enjoys the broad view of all places and with its sharp eyes it can
see everything happening on this world.</p>
